Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days.In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00."What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer.Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday."Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00.Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00,falling $175.00 from yesterday.PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak.The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00plunging $182.50 from yesterday.-Robert Scalabrino


PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high.Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday."Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning," said one PJM-based trader."By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up."Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90per million Btu.Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00range.Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.~

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00,while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down.Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30per million British
thermal units.Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15per million Btu.
     "The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses," one trader said."These are much
more realistic prices."Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild.Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00."What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice," one MAPP trader said."Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off," he said, "and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."-Ken Fahnestock


Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week."There was nothing going on in Florida today," said one
southern energy trader."Everything was going to markets in the
north."Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour."Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out," said on Entergy power trader."Prices,
declined to $60 and less."The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00range.Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices."The cold weather's backing off," said one SPP utility
trader."It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00.Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.-Brian Whary



U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said.Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.-Nick Livingstone


Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume.Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week.These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said."The market's been waiting for this day for a long time," a
Stockholm-based trader said."For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations.We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour.Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.-Nick Livingstone

requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:

work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all

Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.I will

Crocker</span>" &lt;clclegal2@aol.com&gt;Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP &amp; LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the "fiscals".This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent.The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside ,<span type="person" start="59308" end="59320">Larry Lewter</span>or myself prior to calculation of profit , except for a ) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b ) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform .For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?"Please expand.INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus.As you , and I presume<span type="person" start="60642" end="60647">Keith</span>, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating .CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely ,<span type="person" start="61401" end="61426">George Richards President</span>, Creekside Builders , LLC - winmail .datMessage-ID: &lt;18114572.1075855667976.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 26 Sep 2000 09:26:00 -0700 (PDT)

pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside ,<span type="person" start="68379" end="68391">Larry Lewter</span>or myself prior to calculation of profit , except for a ) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b ) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform .For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?"Please expand.INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus.As you , and I presume<span type="person" start="69713" end="69718">Keith</span>, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating .CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely ,<span type="person" start="70472" end="70497">George Richards President</span>, Creekside Builders , LLC - winmail .datMessage-ID: &lt;12266754.1075855668006.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 26 Sep 2000 07:01:00 -0700 (PDT)

Jeff, 
?Is the closing today??After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draftfor a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.?I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim.atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?I will go back to mine and<span type="person" start="80516" end="80529">Phillip Allen</span>'s transaction ?andtake a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature?is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.?I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.?Brenda

capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?Who owns the land?improvements?Who holds the various loans?Is the land collateral?Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?When is the 700,000 actually needed?Now or for the land closing?Investment 
schedule?Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?Looks like it from the cash flow statement.Terms of each loan?Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?By whom?What type of bank account?Controls on max disbursement?Internet viewing 
for investors?Reports to track expenses vs plan?Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?Do you or<span type="person" start="88063" end="88068">Larry</span>receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits ?Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals?Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.Phillip

that we told you about.As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.As
it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.We have included a fence around the entire property , but may only put it on Westgate and<span type="person" start="91404" end="91416">Cameron Loop</span>.Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&amp;D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.<span type="person" start="92377" end="92389">Larry Lewter</span>knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone .I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.<span type="person" start="93958" end="93995">George W.

The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the 
transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.This added 800 shorts to San Juan 
and 200 longs to Socal.Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and

I might become involved with Creekside.Are you in the business of brokering

the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft.plan.This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80psf at $182,000.(I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.Sincerely ,<span type="person" start="111927" end="111964">George W.

that we told you about.As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.As
it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.We have included a fence around the entire property , but may only put it on Westgate and<span type="person" start="114483" end="114495">Cameron Loop</span>.Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&amp;D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.<span type="person" start="115456" end="115468">Larry Lewter</span>knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone .I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.<span type="person" start="117037" end="117074">George W.

computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms.Fast-forward to summer 2000.Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility.Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com.Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy.It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities." We are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall , " said<span type="person" start="127044" end="127074">Karl Karzmar</span>, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound Energy ."That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries."A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads.Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers.The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects.Those base stations could cost as much as $ 20 million each ,<span type="person" start="127873" end="127880">Karzmar</span>said .Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue.On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers.The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream.On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures.Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate." These facilities are what we call extremely dense loads , " said<span type="person" start="128938" end="128947">Bob Royer</span>, director of communications and public affairs at Seattle City Light ."The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts."With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers.Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &amp;
                  Defense.In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies."It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country," boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey.Exodus , ICG Communications ,<span type="person" start="129996" end="130020">NetStream Communications</span>, Pac West Telecomm and Zama Networks all lease space in the office park .After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver.Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country.As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate.But it is not just Seattle.The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California.Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year.While companies
                  such as Amazon.comrun their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management." We have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now than data center space , " said<span type="person" start="131716" end="131728">Steve Porter</span>, an account executive at Exodus in Seattle .The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed."It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,"
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer."The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way."Message-ID: &lt;15247593.1075855668727.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 6 Sep 2000 03:46:00 -0700 (PDT)

reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.The following observations can be made:

  July 1.The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.Aug. 1.The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.Please call with any

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.Then copy this formula to the rows below.2.  Column H needs a formula.Subtract amount paid from amount owed.=e6-g6.3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.this is because the column width 
is too narrow.Use you mouse to click on the line beside the

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising.Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.Current price 37
 Nat.Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.Also, would you be interested in the new class?Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc.start on Aug. 28th.We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.Please let me know.Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.If 
you have any questions, please let me know.Thanks.---------------------- Forwarded by Jana Giovannini/HOU/ECT on 07/11/2000

I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.This is my best guess.I will get back to you with more.PhillipMessage-ID: &lt;4871446.1075855670783.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 13 Jun 2000 07:24:00 -0700 (PDT)

WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between "scheduled" and "actual" 
generation.You are pulling "scheduled."If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the "scheduled" number.The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.I think the presentation looks good.It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.If it is the largest marginal 
consumer then it is obviously a different story.Let's talk.Message-ID: &lt;1735234.1075855670847.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 8 Jun 2000 10:17:00 -0700 (PDT)

I'll take care of it..On PG&amp;E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&amp;l--not change your 
overall p&amp;l.)Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&amp;l impacts of each.139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.<span type="person" start="265078" end="265088">Clay Basin</span>storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five different tickets in Sitara for<span type="person" start="265188" end="265198">Clay Basin</span>activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections .<span type="person" start="265280" end="265290">Clay Basin</span>is valued as a Questar curve , which is substantially below NWPL points .What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.Anyway , here 's the detail on the tickets just for your info , plus I noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from<span type="person" start="265974" end="265984">Clay Basin</span>.There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&amp;L associated with each.Deal #  251327                  159540                   265229

gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?Are there any services we provide?How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?Are 
there elements that you would like to see?Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.Thanks,

Laird

take him?I think $100 should be enough.Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if 
you want to change from printing vertically 
to printing horizontally.Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want 
your print out to be on only one page.Use Print preview
to see what your print out will look like before you print.The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.A valve

Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12.The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork.However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.<span type="person" start="327899" end="327923">Don Badley Message-ID</span>: &lt;12172542.1075855672250.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 28 Feb 2000 03:19:00 -0800 (PST)

Why am I not surprised ?I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths,
this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's
surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our
Master of Lime, 'Arry .Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this
next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise
to some.Me ?My curiosity is piqued and am itchin' to see this Limey

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.I highly recommend<span type="person" start="336363" end="336374">David Moore</span>'s book " The Roman Pantheon " at $ 25.00 - a very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime and clay/pozzolonic ash ; the making and uses of lime in building .The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening.<span type="person" start="336767" end="336778">David Moore</span>spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings , structures , etc. , with simply lime and volcanic ash - structures that have lasted over 2000 years .A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.Thank you , Mr.<span type="person" start="337090" end="337095">Moore</span>.I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.&lt;A HREF="http://www.romanconcrete.com/"&gt;RomanConcrete Research by<span type="person" start="337219" end="337244">David Moore&lt;/A&gt; Regards</span>,<span type="person" start="337247" end="337270">Harry FrancisMessage-ID</span>: &lt;13041580.1075855672433.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 15 Feb 2000 05:42:00 -0800 (PST)

Subject: Choosing a style


I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.Can you help?==========================================

X-FileName: pallen.nsf&gt; Hi,
&gt; We recently faced the same questions concerning our cement floor finishing
&gt; here's what we found.&gt;
&gt; Oringinal Plan: was for stamped and pigmented (color added at the cement
plant)
&gt; with stained accents and highlighting to simulate a sautillo tile.Our
project
&gt; is rather large 2900 sq ft SB house with 1800 sq ft porch surrounding it.Lot's
&gt; of cement approx.160 sq yds.After looking at the costs we changed our
minds
&gt; rather quickly.&gt;
&gt; Labor for Stamping Crew $2500.00&gt;<span type="person" start="367756" end="367773">Davis Color Stain</span>4lbs per yd x 100 yds x $ 18 lb $ 7200.00&gt;
&gt; These are above and beyond the cost of the concrete.&gt;
&gt; Actual Result: Took a truck and trailer to Mexico and handpicked Sautillo
tiles
&gt; for inside the house.Changed the color of the cement on the porch to 1lb
per yd
&gt; mix color, added the overrun tiles we had left over as stringers in the
porch
&gt; and accented with acid etched stain.&gt;
&gt; Tiles and Transportation $3000.00
&gt; Labor, mastic and beer.tile setting (did it myself) $1400.00&gt; Acid Stain for porch $ 350.00 &gt;<span type="person" start="368293" end="368306">Davis Pigment</span>$ 15 x 40 yds $ 600.00 &gt; &gt; I can get you the info on the stain if you like , I ordered it from a company the &gt; web , ca n't remember off hand who .I ordered a sample kit for $35.00 which
has 7
&gt; colors you can mix and match for the results you want.It was easy to work
with
&gt; much like painting in water colors on a large scale.&gt; &gt; Hope this helps you out , &gt; &gt;<span type="person" start="368666" end="368678">Matt Kizziah</span>&gt;Message-ID : &lt;31149192.1075855673084.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 4 Jan 2000 11:39:00 -0800 (PST)

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00range."Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline," said one Southwest trader.According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00range.Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal."We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop," said one Northwest trader.At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.-Robert Scalabrino


Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday."There's just no weather out there," said one PJM-based
trader."There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating.As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long."Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip.Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance.Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.Zone J , which comprises New York City , slipped $ 4.50 to $ 58.50 , while<span type="person" start="409865" end="409870">Zones</span><span type="person" start="409871" end="409872">G</span>and A fell $ 3.25 and $ 5.50 , respectively , to $ 51.25 and $ 40.00 indices .~

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said."It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there," one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said."Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that."The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00,with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday."Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices," an
ECAR trader said.In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska."There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too," one MAPP trader said."It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high.Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00range.In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000."There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have," said one Texas-based utility power trader."Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days.This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00,though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday.Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75.Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45.Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.-Brian Whary


U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short.Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit.The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.-Amal Halawi


Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour."The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said."I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a "more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price.Still, traders said this was
a "high'' spot price for this time of the year.Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.-Alejandro Barbajosa

of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.According to sources , both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against<span type="person" start="439674" end="439679">Davis</span>.The Democratic caucus is reportedly "unwilling to fight " for<span type="person" start="439744" end="439749">Davis</span>.Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust<span type="person" start="439820" end="439825">Davis</span>and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund ,<span type="person" start="439910" end="439915">Davis</span>would "double dip " into the fund .Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.However , it is believed once<span type="person" start="440063" end="440068">Davis</span>discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place .Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.Senator<span type="person" start="441622" end="441627">Bowen</span>'s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy ) .According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.For instance ,<span type="person" start="441973" end="441989">Tony Strickland</span>has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued .Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.Additionally ,<span type="person" start="442224" end="442239">Lehman Brothers</span>reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that<span type="person" start="442334" end="442340">Lehman</span>may back out of the bridge loan .Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount : $ 4.125 B Lenders : JP Morgan $ 2.5 B Lehman Brothers $ 1.0 B Bear Stearns $ 625 M Tax Exempt Portion : Of the $ 4.125 B ; $ 1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate : Taxable Rate 5.77 % Tax-Exempt Rate 4.77 % Current Projected Blended IR : 5.38 % Maturity Date : August 29 , 2001 For more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853-9510<span type="person" start="442789" end="442796">Bill SB</span>6X Passed the Senate Yesterday , but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority .The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and<span type="person" start="444429" end="444434">Davis</span>and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass .If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.Message-ID: &lt;19321959.1075855666306.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 12 Dec 2000 04:53:00 -0800 (PST)

the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.My suggestion for where to go is Austin.Play golf and rent a ski boat and

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1.Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.2. Remote access to your mailbox.After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doeSubstitute "john.doe"with your first and last name, then click ENTER.You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60

the final order will contain a fixed price cap.I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman<span type="person" start="479257" end="479268">Curt Hebert</span>.Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission ,<span type="person" start="479431" end="479437">Hebert</span>had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps : Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution , however short term , that does not increase supply or reduce demand , is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps , in that they would export California 's problems to the West This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter , and it 's a pretty strong anti- price cap position .Of course ,<span type="person" start="479992" end="479998">Hebert</span>is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission , but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking , the item could be bumped off the agenda .Hope this info helps.<span type="person" start="480210" end="480237">Ray Phillip K Allen@ECT</span>04/25/2001 02:28 PM To :<span type="person" start="480262" end="480288">Ray Alvarez/NA/Enron@ENRON</span>cc : Subject : Re : This morning 's Commission meeting delayed Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting ?Is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed

the risk was prior should not matter.Since the rest of the books are very

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.Please email your cost estimates when complete.Thank you ,<span type="person" start="502050" end="502073">Phillip Allen Message-ID</span>: &lt;28834319.1075855694852.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 19 Apr 2001 05:03:00 -0700 (PDT)

March 2000) was absolutely correct.At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to "forced" reductions via rolling blackouts).Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.Meantime, I 
hope this helps.Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information.Message-ID: &lt;2829833.1075855695221.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 10 Apr 2001 07:39:00 -0700 (PDT)

221(d) loans?Although your fees are lower than<span type="person" start="551529" end="551545">George and Larry</span>I am still getting market quotes lower yet .I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.Any ideas?I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.I am not discounting those services.I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.Phillip

X-FileName: pallen.nsf<span type="person" start="562918" end="562924">Reagan</span>, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence .Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?Batts or blown?Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?Double plywood or hardi board underlay?8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.Only about 5 feet.9.I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs.A pedestal sink would probably work.10.Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.11.  1 or 2 A/C units?I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?13.No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?14.Exterior porches included in bid?Cedar decking on upstairs?Iron 
railings?15.What type of construction contract would you use?Fixed price except 
for change orders?I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.Phillip
I

overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.Why is profit only 4%?Why are the architect fees up to $200K.I thought they would be $80K.What is the $617K of profit allowance?Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?That seems very high?Who 
receives the 2 points?How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?What is the status on the operating pro forma?My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.After debt service that would only leave $122K.The coverage 
would only be 1.16.Talk to you this afternoon.Phillip

consecutive day.The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information.But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro &amp; Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.But that still wasn't enough juice.The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh.The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers.It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare.The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high.However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging.The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary.But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%.The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts.A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.But ISO spokesman<span type="person" start="581689" end="581705">Patrick Dorinson</span>said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources ." In order to line up ( more power ) we have to be in a dire situation , "<span type="person" start="581873" end="581881">Dorinson</span>said .Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, PG&amp;E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.SoCal Edison and PG&amp;E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs.The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said.It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.-By<span type="person" start="582472" end="582485">Jason Leopold</span>, Dow<span type="person" start="582491" end="582506">Jones Newswires</span>; 323-658-3874 ; jason .leopold@dowjones.com( END ) Dow<span type="person" start="582559" end="582574">Jones Newswires</span>07-12-00 1318GMT Copyright ( c ) 2000 , Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc 13 :17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO , PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay Pwr Plant ( This article was originally published Wednesday ) LOS ANGELES ( Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy Corp.

dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid

( DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons .The California Independent System Operator , which manages the state 's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets , and the California Public Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns , ISO spokesman<span type="person" start="584999" end="585011">Pat Dorinson</span>said .The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance.The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.AES told the visitors they could n't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company 's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning , when the plant 's full staff would be present , AES spokesman<span type="person" start="585801" end="585813">Aaron Thomas</span>said .<span type="person" start="585820" end="585826">Thomas</span>, as well as an ISO spokesman , did n't know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection .AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits.They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed ,<span type="person" start="586288" end="586294">Thomas</span>said .AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line.The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting." We 'd be happy to put our units back , provided we do n't get sued for it , "<span type="person" start="586735" end="586741">Thomas</span>said ."It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's" authority.As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday." I guess our position is , ' Gee , we 're sorry you do n't believe us , but if you need to come and take a look for yourself , that 's fine , '" said Dynegy spokesman<span type="person" start="587417" end="587430">Lynn Lednicky</span>.Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired."We've been doing all we can to get back in service," Lednicky said."We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited."Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.-By<span type="person" start="587858" end="587874">Jessica Berthold</span>, Dow Jones Newswires ; 323-658-3872 , jessica.berthold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00

Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.It is not my desire for
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.The only item from your list
that I need further
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.You mentioned that this
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash

investment.My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the

earnest money would be applied.I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.Can you help clear

FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week.According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff.The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves.BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.Message-ID: &lt;28968716.1075855696255.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 15 Mar 2001 06:11:00 -0800 (PST)

As shown on the attached summary table , cash expenditures total $ 21,196 and existing contracts to the architect , civil engineer , soils testing company , and appraisal total $ 67,050. ? The due on these contracts is $ 61,175 , of which current unpaid invoices due total $ 37,325 .Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM.? However , in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects , we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $ 15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead . ? As shown in the attached table , this fee , plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $ 78,946. ? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided . ? However , if you accept the terms of this buyout offer , which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable , then , we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both . ? If this is your choice , either contact us , or have your attorney contact our attorney ,<span type="person" start="615269" end="615284">Claudia Crocker</span>, no later than Friday of this week . ? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner , Ltd.Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.Thank you.?Sincerely,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.I spoke to<span type="person" start="617886" end="617900">Hugo Alexandro</span>at Cuatro Consultants .The property is 
still in two parcels.Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.<span type="person" start="619031" end="619036">Keith</span>and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday .We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.PhillipMessage-ID: &lt;7032342.1075855696407.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 14 Mar 2001 03:49:00 -0800 (PST)

????March 13, 2001?<span type="person" start="621892" end="621925">Phillip Allen Keith Holst ENRON</span>1400 Smith Street Houston , TX ? 77002-7361 Subject : Bishops Corner , Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout Dear Phillip and<span type="person" start="622044" end="622049">Keith</span>: We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner , Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures ; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts . ? As shown on the attached summary table , cash expenditures total $ 21,196 and existing contracts to the architect , civil engineer , soils testing company , and appraisal total $ 67,050. ? The due on these contracts is $ 61,175 , of which current unpaid invoices due total $ 37,325 .Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM.? However , in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects , we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $ 15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead . ? As shown in the attached table , this fee , plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $ 78,946. ? We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided . ? However , if you accept the terms of this buyout offer , which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable , then , we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both . ? If this is your choice , either contact us , or have your attorney contact our attorney ,<span type="person" start="624239" end="624254">Claudia Crocker</span>, no later than Friday of this week . ? The attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the Bishops Corner , Ltd.Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.Thank you.?Sincerely,

project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.3. A market vacancy factor of 5 % was applied to Potential<span type="person" start="632110" end="632122">Gross Income</span>( PGI ) .4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.The debt service will be approx.$874,000/year.6.Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit&amp; Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.(See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.I would like 
to proceed and develop the property.My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.I look forward to working with you.Talk to you tomorrow.PhillipMessage-ID: &lt;21886864.1075855696604.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 7 Mar 2001 05:00:00 -0800 (PST)

addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&amp;N
total of rentable units.Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.<span type="person" start="662439" end="662476">George W. Richards Creekside Builders</span>, LLC - SM134 Proforma2.xlsMessage-ID: &lt;1449186.1075855697095.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 21 Feb 2001 07:58:00 -0800 (PST)

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.<span type="person" start="665150" end="665159">Doug Bell</span>will meet with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the subject .It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.We may close this deal in April.The Stage is still on go.An assumption package has been sent to the buyer , and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the details to<span type="person" start="665762" end="665773">Wayne McCoy</span>.I will be gone Thurs.and Fri. of this week.I will be checking my

addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&amp;N
total of rentable units.Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.<span type="person" start="670576" end="670613">George W. Richards Creekside Builders</span>, LLC - SM134 Proforma2.xlsMessage-ID: &lt;1630423.1075855697206.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 21 Feb 2001 07:22:00 -0800 (PST)

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the "assume it is messed up" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.Are we looking at 
everything we should?Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.Phillip

superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.Then there is a layer of "construction management" 
fees of 10%.There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.But I think the majority of it is profit.Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.<span type="person" start="677798" end="677803">Keith</span>and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit .After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.<span type="person" start="678363" end="678369">George</span>gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard .I will 
review and let you know what I think.The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only 
true costs + 1.4 million.Phillip

Please excuse my oversight is not getting the proforma back to you in a 
usable format.? I did not realize that I had selected winmail.datrather than 
sending it as an attachment.??Then, I did not notice that I had overlooked 
your email until today.??That spread sheet is attached and an updated 
proforma will go out to you this evening or tomorrow morning with a timeline.?<span type="person" start="685067" end="685105">George W.

earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and 
send it back.Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.I will probably send

I checked the transport model and found the following extrinsic values on 
January 2nd versus February 11:

   1/2  2/11

Stanfield to Malin 209  81

SJ/Perm. to Socal 896  251

Sj to Socal  2747  768

PGE/Top to Citygate 51  3

PGE/Top to KRS 16  4

SJ to Valero  916  927


If these numbers are correct, then we haven't increased the extrinsic value 
since the beginning of the year.Can you confirm that I am looking at the

that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.You guys can make changes

1.I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.Tried to call<span type="person" start="705802" end="705806">Wade</span>last night at 5:30 but could n't reach him .Will try again today.I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.Did you meet

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?The key business points are:

1.Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.<span type="person" start="707782" end="707787">Keith</span>and I would like to oversee the bookkeeping .The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.Let me know if you can draft these agreements.The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.<span type="person" start="708151" end="708164">Phillip Allen</span>713-853-7041 pallen@enron.comMessage-ID: &lt;12154178.1075855666678.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 29 Nov 2000 02:02:00 -0800 (PST)

sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.PhillipMessage-ID: &lt;10216616.1075855697987.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 6 Feb 2001 01:01:00 -0800 (PST)

reasons that I won't commit to this.Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.That is a long time.The buyer may have sold the 
property.Interest rates may be lower.I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.Can you clarify the dates in the contract.Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.Email or call  me later today.Phillip

X-FileName: pallen.nsf<span type="person" start="730681" end="730687">George</span>, The probability of building a house this year is increasing .I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan.Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.pallen70@hotmail.comor 713-463-8626(home ) , 713-853-7041(work )<span type="person" start="732186" end="732205">Phillip Allen PS.</span>Channel 2 in Houston ran a story yesterday (Feb.2) about a home in

X-FileName: pallen.nsf<span type="person" start="734741" end="734745">Jeff</span>, Before you write off the stage , a few things to think about .1.Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.3.  Considering #1 &amp; #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.A 10% note actually attractive.See below.My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.Do you want to reconsider?Let me know.Phillip

SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001.Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion.The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.II.Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.III.Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates.Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.IV.Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million.This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year.However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA.Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.VI.Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII.Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.==20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20

recouped in the first year of operation.At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home ( 713)463-8626<span type="person" start="763175" end="763197">Phillip Message-ID</span>: &lt;23755959.1075855698595.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Fri, 26 Jan 2001 07:15:00 -0800 (PST)

complete.PG&amp;E is OK with the docs.All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&amp;E would "retain" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&amp;E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing).The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).PG&amp;E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table.QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment.SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&amp;E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&amp;E's 
purchases from such QFs.Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly.Not clear this can be 
resolved.Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.No discussions on this 
occurred today.Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .Hydro as security is

#32 and #29 are fine.#28 paid weekly on 1/5.Then he switched to biweekly.He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.Two weeks rent in advance.Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.He is only paid one week in advance.This is not a

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number.The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather.Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights." Traders do that all the time ; they 're looking forward , " said<span type="person" start="781611" end="781625">William Burson</span>, a trader ."It makes the market for natural gas."But the market 's response perplexed<span type="person" start="781715" end="781727">Chris McGill</span>, the American Gas Association 's director of gas supply and transportation .He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality." It 's a little frustrating that they do n't take the time to understand what we are reporting , "<span type="person" start="782082" end="782088">McGill</span>said .As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on.Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street.<span type="person" start="782274" end="782286">Stephen Adik</span>, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource , recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market 's speculators for the rise in gas prices ."It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes.Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared." We 're passing on our gas costs , which we have no control over , " said<span type="person" start="783263" end="783275">Paul Snider</span>, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy .But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers." There 's been a failure of risk management by utilities , and that needs to change , " said<span type="person" start="783481" end="783491">Ed Krapels</span>, director of gas power services for Energy Security Analysis Inc. , an energy consulting firm in Wakefield , Mass .Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply.In 
many circles, little else is discussed.The Rev.<span type="person" start="783750" end="783764">Vincent Fraser</span>of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is facing a $ 1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous December 's bill .Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well.The Sunday collection is down , said<span type="person" start="784015" end="784021">Fraser</span>, who might have to forgo part of his salary .For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating."It's the talk of the town here," he said.A year ago that wasn't a fear.Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas.Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers.But trouble was brewing.By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter.There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded.By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet.The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.But $10 gas was coming.Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets."It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders.Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world.Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float.In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices.The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years.Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce.And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use.There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas.But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading.Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit.That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time.As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet.By the end of the month it was nearly $10.Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers.Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter.Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient.But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994.Still , said the association 's<span type="person" start="787427" end="787433">McGill</span>, there was sufficient gas in storage .But some utility executives didn't share that view.<span type="person" start="787526" end="787541">William Eliason</span>, vice president of Kansas Gas Service , said that if December 's cold snap had continued into January , there could have been a real problem meeting demand ."I was getting worried," he said.Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer.Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers.Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet.And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.<span type="person" start="788295" end="788307">Sheila Lumpe</span>, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission , said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs , little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy .Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter.Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program.It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills.And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs.On Friday ,<span type="person" start="789122" end="789134">Doug Micheel</span>, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public Counsel , said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy 's gas purchasing practices ." Consumers are taking all the risk , "<span type="person" start="789384" end="789391">Micheel</span>said ."It's time to consider 
some changes."To reach<span type="person" start="789449" end="789461">Steve Everly</span>, call ( 816 ) 234-4455 or send e-mail to severly@kcstar.com .------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why did so many tenants not pay this week?#12 95
#21 240
#27 120
#28 260
#33 260

Total 975

It seems these apartments just missed rent.What is up?Other questions:

#9-Why didn't they pay anything?By my records, they still owe $40 plus rent 
should have been due on 12/12 of $220.#3-Why did they short pay?Message-ID: &lt;2784209.1075855698995.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 15 Jan 2001 23:25:00 -0800 (PST)

Subject: SM134 Proforma.xlsEnclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.I hope to finish the proforma today.The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3

garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.- winmail.datMessage-ID: &lt;29620511.1075855699125.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Fri, 12 Jan 2001 05:18:00 -0800 (PST)

recouped in the first year of operation.At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.Feel free to call me at home ( 713)463-8626<span type="person" start="807956" end="807977">Phillip Message-ID</span>: &lt;14810202.1075855699255.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 9 Jan 2001 03:06:00 -0800 (PST)

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.There 
are alot of overages.It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.I will write 
something today.Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.PhillipMessage-ID: &lt;8291442.1075855699277.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 8 Jan 2001 23:36:00 -0800 (PST)

X-FileName: pallen.nsfQuestions about 12/29 rentroll:

 There were two deposits that were not labeled.One for $150 and the other 
for $75.Which apartments?20a or #13?Utility overages for #26 and #44?Where did you get these amounts?For 
what periods?What is going on with #42.Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.Is this 
right?Has the deposit been made yet?A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.PhillipMessage-ID: &lt;26307860.1075855699363.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 4 Jan 2001 04:10:00 -0800 (PST)

spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed ( based on my discussions with several of you ) as well as some background materials<span type="person" start="820082" end="820096">Jeff Dasovich</span>and I prepared .Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration.The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".Some of these ideas would require legislative action.State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of 
generation plants.The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.This 
was a frequently recurring theme.Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.Expand in-state gas production.Take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how Nordpool works(<span type="person" start="823261" end="823266">Jeff -</span>someone in Schroeder 's group should be able to help out here ) .Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.To dos : (<span type="person" start="823711" end="823715">Jeff</span>, again I 'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group 's thoughts and get them to Kari ) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips .He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.Thanks to everyone for their help.We made some progress today.Message-ID: &lt;24305810.1075855699452.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 28 Dec 2000 05:19:00 -0800 (PST)

was positive about his experience overall.He did not seem pleased with the 
bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.I think we should discuss 
these procedures in advance.Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.PhillipMessage-ID: &lt;27827638.1075855699517.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 27 Dec 2000 08:00:00 -0800 (PST)

San Marcos.There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a "forward commitment" in order to reduce the 
equity required.I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks.I am faxing you a project summary.And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.Let me know what else you need.The land is scheduled to close mid January.<span type="person" start="829088" end="829111">Phillip Allen Message-ID</span>: &lt;17440180.1075855699538.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 27 Dec 2000 04:43:00 -0800 (PST)

you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.This creates a shortage in later months.2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.Specific questions should include:  

  1.Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.This market has been long historically.It has been a buyers market 
and the

 I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.The critical information is  1.Move in or lease start date
      2.  Lease expiration date
      3.  Rent
      4.  Deposit 
  
  If you have the info you can
  fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants
      2.  Workplace
      

  All the new leases should be the long form.The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated 
back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.I really need to get this by tomorrow.Please use the rentroll_1215 file to 
input the correct information on all these tenants.And email it to me 
tomorrow.You should have all this information on their leases and 
applications.PhillipMessage-ID: &lt;33197631.1075855699841.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 14 Dec 2000 06:15:00 -0800 (PST)

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should

Crocker</span>" &lt;clclegal2@aol.com&gt;Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.LAND OWNERSHIP &amp; LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the "fiscals".This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent.The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.Phasing works as follows.If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.These fees are the only monies to Creekside ,<span type="person" start="888657" end="888669">Larry Lewter</span>or myself prior to calculation of profit , except for a ) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b ) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform .For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.What did you have in mind?I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?"Please expand.INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus.As you , and I presume<span type="person" start="889991" end="889996">Keith</span>, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating .CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.Sincerely ,<span type="person" start="890750" end="890775">George Richards President</span>, Creekside Builders , LLC - winmail .datMessage-ID: &lt;29403111.1075855665483.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 13 Dec 2000 08:22:00 -0800 (PST)

Phillip,

&gt; As discussed  during our phone conversation, In a Parallon 75 microturbine
&gt; power generation deal for a national accounts customer, I am developing a
&gt; proposal to sell power to customer at fixed or collar/floor price.To do
&gt; so I need a corresponding term gas price for same.Microturbine is an
&gt; onsite generation product developed by Honeywell to generate electricity
&gt; on customer site (degen).using natural gas.In doing so,  I need your
&gt; best fixed price forward gas price deal for 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years for
&gt; annual/seasonal supply to microturbines to generate fixed kWh for
&gt; customer.We have the opportunity to sell customer kWh 's using
&gt; microturbine or sell them turbines themselves.kWh deal must have limited/
&gt; no risk forward gas price to make deal work.Therein comes Sempra energy
&gt; gas trading, truly you.&gt;
&gt; We are proposing installing 180 - 240 units across a large number of
&gt; stores (60-100) in San Diego.&gt; Store number varies because of installation hurdles face at small percent.&gt;
&gt; For 6-8 hours a day  Microturbine run time:

interesting changes.Also, you can click on the URL below to go to the EBS intranet site, where 
you will find all sorts of information related to EBS, its market and 
competition, etc.As a "high-tech" company, they actually do keep this

want to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which may 
not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team 
have requested our involvement with.I also want to make sure I'm bringing 
resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent 
developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received 
from the NYC office re:  Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, 
where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be 
with one of their medical groups based in Chicago.After several 
unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant 
category.Yesterday ,<span type="person" start="904977" end="904985">Jennifer</span>forwarded me information requesting engagement with your team on CA ( Computer Associates ) and U.S. Internetworking , and today American Express has surfaced .<span type="person" start="905146" end="905158">Consequently</span>, I think it 's probably a good idea for me to make sure I 'm focused on the right accounts for you .I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would 
work?If not, I would have Monday the 18th available late afternoon, or any 
time on December 27th, 28th, or 29th.When would be good for you?Please 
let me know!Thank you ,<span type="person" start="905517" end="905532">Jeff Message-ID</span>: &lt;4536765.1075857613370.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 11 Jan 2001 07:00:00 -0800 (PST)

1.How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?$4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services
2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 
3.  Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving 
purchase commitment from Enron?Not sure what you mean here
4.  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be 
done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?We prefer the 14th, but if we can't get it until the 15th, that will work


Please let me know if you have any other questions.I will call you tomorrow 
to touch base.Thanks,

the guys.Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot

found the test to be mildly amusing.And since I had no idea what 'club no

lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on 
what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters.And 
when I was a marketer, I found a few leads.Finally, since a lot of the

not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for

deal.With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week.It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products.The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter.But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year.Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said." The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we do n't know what they 're going to use to grow crops with , " said<span type="person" start="974044" end="974054">David Wyss</span>, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor 's .Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy.Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year."Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded.Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production.Like Kaiser , the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices , which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract , said<span type="person" start="975233" end="975247">Mark Rosenbury</span>, chief administrative officer ."We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.Terra has n't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas , but<span type="person" start="975422" end="975431">Rosenbury</span>said it would be " substantial . "In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed.It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point.That would keep Terra 's plants closed ,<span type="person" start="975690" end="975699">Rosenbury</span>said , but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit ." If this persists , "<span type="person" start="975793" end="975802">Rosenbury</span>said , "it 's going to be a real problem . "He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now."Could we be short of fertilizer next spring?It 's possible that farmers will not have as much as they want , "<span type="person" start="976106" end="976115">Rosenbury</span>said .Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month.The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production." We believe it 's likely this is a speculative bubble [in natural gas prices ] that will burst and in a few weeks we 'll be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price , but that remains to be seen , " said<span type="person" start="976638" end="976652">Paul M. Murphy</span>, the company 's managing director for financial planning .A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said."It's sticker shock."According to<span type="person" start="976923" end="976927">Wyss</span>, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above $ 7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago -- farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002 .In the aluminum industry , several smaller producers have joined Kaiser , the industry 's No. 2 manufacturer , in closing down , noted<span type="person" start="977257" end="977272">Lloyd O'Carroll</span>, an analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond .Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said."We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think," he said.A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies."But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast," he said.In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep.Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $ 22.50 a megawatt per hour , says spokesman<span type="person" start="978003" end="978013">Scott Lamb</span>.That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants , to invest in new electric generating capacity , or even to refund to Bonneville 's other customers , said Bonneville spokesman<span type="person" start="978377" end="978385">Ed Mosey</span>.Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits."Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal.There has to be an ethical dimension to this and we 're not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power , "<span type="person" start="978841" end="978846">Mosey</span>said ., 2000 The Washington Post Company

deal.With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week.It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products.The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter.But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year.Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said." The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we do n't know what they 're going to use to grow crops with , " said<span type="person" start="983460" end="983470">David Wyss</span>, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor 's .Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy.Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year."Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded.Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production.Like Kaiser , the company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices , which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its existing December supply contract , said<span type="person" start="984649" end="984663">Mark Rosenbury</span>, chief administrative officer ."We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.Terra has n't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas , but<span type="person" start="984838" end="984847">Rosenbury</span>said it would be " substantial . "In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed.It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point.That would keep Terra 's plants closed ,<span type="person" start="985106" end="985115">Rosenbury</span>said , but eliminate the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit ." If this persists , "<span type="person" start="985209" end="985218">Rosenbury</span>said , "it 's going to be a real problem . "He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now."Could we be short of fertilizer next spring?It 's possible that farmers will not have as much as they want , "<span type="person" start="985522" end="985531">Rosenbury</span>said .Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month.The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production." We believe it 's likely this is a speculative bubble [in natural gas prices ] that will burst and in a few weeks we 'll be able to buy gas at a more reasonable price , but that remains to be seen , " said<span type="person" start="986054" end="986068">Paul M. Murphy</span>, the company 's managing director for financial planning .A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said."It's sticker shock."According to<span type="person" start="986339" end="986343">Wyss</span>, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas remains above $ 7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago -- farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002 .In the aluminum industry , several smaller producers have joined Kaiser , the industry 's No. 2 manufacturer , in closing down , noted<span type="person" start="986673" end="986688">Lloyd O'Carroll</span>, an analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond .Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said."We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think," he said.A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies."But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast," he said.In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep.Kaiser is contractually entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $ 22.50 a megawatt per hour , says spokesman<span type="person" start="987419" end="987429">Scott Lamb</span>.That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants , to invest in new electric generating capacity , or even to refund to Bonneville 's other customers , said Bonneville spokesman<span type="person" start="987793" end="987801">Ed Mosey</span>.Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits."Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal.There has to be an ethical dimension to this and we 're not shy in trying to make sure they live up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power , "<span type="person" start="988257" end="988262">Mosey</span>said ., 2000 The Washington Post Company

implied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5).Perhaps 
surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and 
gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result.Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 
kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build.The cold 
weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well 
above last year's Y2K inflated levels.Most of the draw was in low sulphur 
material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks.However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.
Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not 
the finished material.Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production?Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. 
Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly 
high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.Message-ID: &lt;20399547.1075857614321.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 19 Dec 2000 08:55:00 -0800 (PST)

We have added a couple of pieces to this and it could bring the cost to 125 k 
worst case.This quote covers consulting and maintenance.They are trying 
very hard to get a deal done this year  and we could probably get our 
additional components at the current quote price if we signed.BMC, Control -M
Approx.325 k   This is after we remove the SAP modules and components from 
the quote.Quote that was sent over from<span type="person" start="1027295" end="1027310">Jeff Youngflesh</span>( Enron GSS) was for a total of 628 k Hardware for either product is approx .300 k.We have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to take 
over their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our long 
term strategy.They actually do not recommend either of these product's SAP 
modules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectors 
into BMC.We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft (<span type="person" start="1027784" end="1027789">Larry</span>if you have info on this please comment ) .<span type="person" start="1027833" end="1027838">Larry</span>'s and his team have eval 'd both products and although they are leaning towards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable .You 
guys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight it 
will lend to the EBS/BMC deal.FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45% 
discount if we cut the SAP modules.BMC needs to sit down with PB and learn 
how over priced their products are !Let me know what you think.If we go TidalSoft I need to push this through 
or be advised to let it go till the New Year.Thanks<span type="person" start="1028389" end="1028394">Bruce</span>***** Also in Quote sent over from Youngflesh : BMC , Control SA 1.3 M NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME - Is a candidate for future consideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculate as to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS.I guess they put this quote together from info they received from<span type="person" start="1028731" end="1028757">Henry Moreno Message-ID</span>: &lt;25815211.1075857616816.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Sat, 14 Oct 2000 10:25:00 -0700 (PDT)

X-FileName: jarnold.nsf<span type="person" start="1052945" end="1052953">Jennifer</span>, Thanks for hosting the meeting yesterday .Sorry I had to leave but I had to meet with<span type="person" start="1053042" end="1053055">Beth Pearlman</span>.I believe there was a lot of good information
exchanged and that is why we ran so late.I certainly came away with a
different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met.Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some
things are very clear in our go forward strategy.At the end of the day , the account team (<span type="person" start="1053402" end="1053414">Dave Spurlin</span>up through Jeff , myself and<span type="person" start="1053443" end="1053448">Jerry</span>) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship .If
corporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the
account.<span type="person" start="1053586" end="1053601">Peter Blackmore</span>is very clear about that .He was always preserved
the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer.That is why we need to keep<span type="person" start="1053753" end="1053757">Dave</span>focused and knowing what transactions are taking place within Enron .He isn't the decision maker on deals like the
EBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other
business opportunities within Enron.<span type="person" start="1053986" end="1053990">Dave</span>'s sole responsibility is Enron and making sure that your needs are being met .He will direct and assist in
making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the
relationship with Enron.I need your help with all Enron organizations to make sure that they use<span type="person" start="1054264" end="1054268">Dave</span>as the focal point .If folks continue to go
around him, situations like EBS will continue.He has to have the total
picture of business transactions happening at Enron.He will understand how
those situations can impact the business at and for Enron.Secondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts
with Enron.Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the
sixth year being optional.The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per
year.I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years.So at 5 years the value is $80.5M.If you have something different, let's
make sure that we are on the same page.I have attached the emails that I
received this data from.&lt;&lt;RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.&gt;&gt;  &lt;&lt;RE: Enron Building
Services Novi MI.&gt;&gt;

Regarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level
set very quickly.Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive
light.Compaq will honor it's commitments but we need to make sure that
Enron does the same.The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of
expectations relative to Compaq's revenue from EBS versus what actually got
booked.Our expectations were $96M a year  based on the forecast provided by
EBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday).I find it
very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held
accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don't have the revenue to
off set it.Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based
on expectations that were set.I will speak to<span type="person" start="1055886" end="1055891">Keith</span>and<span type="person" start="1055896" end="1055899">Rob</span>this morning to see how it was left .I also need to get your perspective on the

analysis it looks like we overestimated the opportunity.The circuits Dietmar is requesting is a european E1 which equates to a US
T1.The hub (Wallfdorf) -and-spoke (Hungary, Netherlands, UK) model SAP requires
works out to roughly a $2.09M deal.Clearly this is smaller than both parties would prefer.Thus we would like to
know if there are growth plans for one or more of these connections so that
we
can we propose a larger pipe (i.e.European E3/US DS3).For example if just one of the connections can be an E3 for the entire
contract
(ten years) it would bump the value up to $8.5M.Please review this and
let's
plan on talking later today.Another model to consider would be to
progressively
bump up the pipe size across all the connections at set intervals (i.e.
years
1-3 = E1, years 4-6 = E2, years 7-10 = E3).Please let me know what your thoughts are and let 's talk<span type="person" start="1079157" end="1079162">ASAP.</span>-------------------------------------------------------------<span type="person" start="1079226" end="1079246">Gary Waxman Director</span>, Enterprise Group Enron Broadband Services 2100 SW River Parkway Portland , OR 97201 Mobile : 503-807-8923 Desk : 503-886-0196 Fax : 503-886-0441 ------------------------------------------------------------- |--------+-----------------------&gt; | | curtis .meyer@ || | sap.com | | | | | | 12/08/00 | | | 09:54 AM | | | | |--------+-----------------------&gt; &gt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -| | | | To :<span type="person" start="1079844" end="1079897">Gary Waxman/Enron Communications@Enron Communications</span>| | cc : dennis.gooden@sap.com ,michael.bannon@sap.com|

completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is 
also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the 
purchase decision).As you know , both<span type="person" start="1085165" end="1085177">Randy Matson</span>and<span type="person" start="1085182" end="1085195">Bob McAuliffe</span>are out on vacation , so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas .However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to 
surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation.In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with 
the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at 
EBS.The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema 
Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, 
especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation.Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential 
vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC 
purchase at this point.I will be on vacation next week, but will be 
checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th.<span type="person" start="1086065" end="1086073">Jennifer</span>or I will keep you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor .I have sent you a paraphrased version of<span type="person" start="1086203" end="1086207">Doug</span>'s most recent communication to me .The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net 
Works teams in question:  more testing, but looks like BMC's total sales 
opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your 
deal done.The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from 
yesterday still apply.Thank you ,<span type="person" start="1086574" end="1086585">Jeff -----</span>Forwarded by<span type="person" start="1086599" end="1086623">Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron</span>on 12/15/2000 05 :15 PM -----<span type="person" start="1086655" end="1086674">Douglas Cummins@ECT</span>12/15/2000 04 :14 PM To :<span type="person" start="1086706" end="1086736">Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON</span>cc : Subject : Re : BMC Summary to-date<span type="person" start="1086782" end="1086786">Jeff</span>, We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - we feel that a competitor 's solution is a better one for us .My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be an excellent

Net Works will still evaluate more similar tools, and related design tools, 
before making a decision.Regards ,<span type="person" start="1087159" end="1087177">Douglas Message-ID</span>: &lt;16075289.1075849627202.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 18 Dec 2000 00:52:00 -0800 (PST)

it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the 
relationship owners.During the meeting yesterday - the following happened : a )<span type="person" start="1095377" end="1095392">Keith McAuliffe</span>announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately ( his replacement has yet to be named ) .My perception is that<span type="person" start="1095514" end="1095519">Keith</span>took the hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales projections .EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected 
targets.b )<span type="person" start="1095687" end="1095697">Bob Jordan</span>- Director NA Sales reporting to<span type="person" start="1095731" end="1095742">Jerry Earle</span>will expand his existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server Agreement c ) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS Services .For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed 
at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 
8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters.EBS sent 
Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th.Compaq has not paid the 
invoice.<span type="person" start="1096237" end="1096247">Lou Casari</span>'s team is handling the delinquency and notifying Compaq .Compaq (<span type="person" start="1096316" end="1096324">Keith M.</span>'s stewardship ) had agreed to pay .<span type="person" start="1096360" end="1096363">Bob</span>stated that EBS has not performed to Compaq 's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS services (<span type="person" start="1096540" end="1096543">Bob</span>'s first negotiation position ) .d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in 
the EBS Server Spend amount.Compaq (<span type="person" start="1096697" end="1096707">Bob Jordan</span>) value - EBS purchase of $ 5.1 million for servers and hardware in 2000 EBS (added ) - EBS purchase value would add an additional $ 1.0 million for servers and hardware in 2000 EBS (added ) - EBS purchase of $ 4.9 million for servers and hardware in 1999 EBS (added ) - EBS purchase of $ 3.1 million in Compaq professional services ( costs for Server deployment ) From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the following might occur EBS total is $ 14.1 million spend for 1999/2000 at 8 % would equal a Compaq purchase amount of $ 1.128 million ( w/out the 2 fixed quarters ) Compaq total is $ 5.1 million spend at 8 % would equal a Compaq purchase amount of $ 408,000 EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount is $ 4,134,229 .(I did not concede) 

 e) 2000 income.Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had 
to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could 
defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, 
2002.If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the 
right to spend against the amount.To gain 2000 income recognition , EBS worked with<span type="person" start="1097925" end="1097932">Keith M</span>and<span type="person" start="1097937" end="1097948">Rob Senders</span>to invoice for $ 832,000 to cover EBS consulting services provided to Compaq .Again , under<span type="person" start="1098042" end="1098049">Keith M</span>'s stewardship - they verbally agreed to pay .Now with the above information - my offered next steps :
 a) Until everything is done - maintain the "stick" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 
million).This is being done.b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee.It 
does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages.Prior conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $ 2.5 million termination fee ( again with<span type="person" start="1098497" end="1098504">Keith M</span>) .This could be recognized as yr 2000 income.c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on 
services of $4.1 million.This is a good return for a commodity 
transaction.So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier 
relationship.So...... please let me know your thougths.We have countered with the $2.5 
million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000.Please let me know your thoughts<span type="person" start="1098977" end="1098997">Kim Godfrey Director</span>, Enterprise Services Enron Broadband Services phone : 713 345 8813 cell : 713 501 8105 fax : 713 853 7354 Message-ID : &lt;31644258.1075849627250.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 18 Dec 2000 03:42:00 -0800 (PST)

(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.After our meeting on Dec 14th , EBS now understands to utilize<span type="person" start="1111050" end="1111063">David Spurlin</span>as the point person for these communications .EBS had prior direction from Compaq to direct our discussions to<span type="person" start="1111178" end="1111193">Derrick Deakins</span>,<span type="person" start="1111195" end="1111206">Rob Senders</span>,<span type="person" start="1111208" end="1111224">Keith McAuliffe</span>or<span type="person" start="1111228" end="1111238">Kent Major</span>.<span type="person" start="1111241" end="1111253">Tracy Prater</span>and myself look forward to spending additional time with<span type="person" start="1111312" end="1111317">David</span>to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and issues .EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop 
the streaming media server solutions.We discussed during the Dec 14th 
meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product 
and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media 
solutions.EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the 
intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these 
solutions.To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the 
appropriate next steps to further our relationship.The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework 
for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.Until 
those changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq 
was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 
7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.Compaq had agreed  to the invoice 
amount.EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 
on or before December 31,2000.2 ) Potential for Agreement Termination : Prior to the Dec 14th meeting , Compaq (<span type="person" start="1112569" end="1112574">Keith</span>and<span type="person" start="1112579" end="1112582">Rob</span>) have discussed this with EBS (<span type="person" start="1112614" end="1112625">Jim Crowder</span>, myself ) .The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written 
notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.The concept to start over with a 
new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if 
Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we 
look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create 
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.<span type="person" start="1113219" end="1113239">Kim Godfrey Director</span>, Enterprise Services Enron Broadband Services phone : 713 345 8813 cell : 713 501 8105 fax : 713 853 7354Message-ID : &lt;28964864.1075849627373.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 18 Dec 2000 10:11:00 -0800 (PST)

August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and 
identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.There was a group of at least 8 Compaq attendees (<span type="person" start="1127059" end="1127070">Chris Sweet</span>took extensive notes for Compaq ) .Both 
EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq 
Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.Spreadsheets were exchanged between 
both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.A significant amount of time 
was spent in this process between August through October.EBS and Compaq (<span type="person" start="1127424" end="1127439">Derrick Deakins</span>) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 sections .This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (<span type="person" start="1127555" end="1127558">Rob</span>and<span type="person" start="1127563" end="1127570">Derrick</span>) for comments in November .EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain 
points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed 
to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.The EBS 
concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate 
the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.This was reason for the 
development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with

the
streaming media server solutions.We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting
that
there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server
Supply
Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.EBS and
Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product
and
Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.To that end, EBS has
had
internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our
relationship.The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework
for
our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.Until those
changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq
was
invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,
2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.Compaq had agreed  to the invoice
amount.EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section
3.0 on
or before December 31,2000.2 ) Potential for Agreement Termination : Prior to the Dec 14th meeting , Compaq (<span type="person" start="1132189" end="1132194">Keith</span>and<span type="person" start="1132199" end="1132202">Rob</span>) have discussed this with EBS (<span type="person" start="1132234" end="1132245">Jim Crowder</span>, myself ) .The
understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice
and
payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.The concept to start over with a new
contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.EBS
strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq
believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look
forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.<span type="person" start="1132827" end="1132847">Kim Godfrey Director</span>,<span type="person" start="1132849" end="1132874">Enterprise Services Enron</span>Broadband Services phone : 713 345 8813 cell : 713 501 8105 fax : 713 853 7354 Message-ID : &lt;21476230.1075849627569.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 19 Dec 2000 02:26:00 -0800 (PST)

without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely 
fashion.The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are 
not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and 
not in writing).Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the 
(Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) "...haven't 
kept up with the industry", and that they (Net Works) have some residual 
issues with the BMC account support in general.Bottom Line, expressed by 
Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC 
software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.You related<span type="person" start="1146894" end="1146905">Jim Crowder</span>'s suggestion related to the use of indemnification and liquidated damages clauses being implemented .<span type="person" start="1147009" end="1147017">Jennifer</span>and I discussed this situation , and our meetings with your team , in context .We have a 
possible alternative for you to consider:  perhaps EBS might provide a hedge 
for Net Works in the form of "advance purchase" of BMC product.For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but 
needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total 
Enron purchases from BMC.A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark 
with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC 
time to "click" might be this:  EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC 
software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other 
$2 million is used as a "future purchases" fund, in which EBS buys, but does 
not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current 
software...

THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of 
BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is 
delivered from/by BMC.That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other 
business units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which they 
seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product 
when they need it in the future).In addition, you secure the business with 
BMC right now.I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for the 
time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to 
you.If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the 
meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on 
progress.Thanks ,<span type="person" start="1148663" end="1148693">Jeff Jeff Youngflesh Director</span>, Business Development Global Strategic Sourcing Enron Corp. 333 Clay Street , 11th Floor Houston , TX 77002 t : 713-345-5968 f : 713-646-2450 c : 713-410-6716Message-ID : &lt;28734315.1075849631262.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 22 Feb 2001 08:20:00 -0800 (PST)

Offset to Last Trade functionality.<span type="person" start="1163338" end="1163341">The</span>simplified description is : It tracks two variables : Intensity( Speed ) and Bias ( Buy or Sell emphasis ) .As Intensity increases, the Spread increases.As Bias increases, the Offset increases.I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.<span type="person" start="1163587" end="1163603">Dave Program</span>Criteria The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to work with several criteria/inputs/definitions .These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells.Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow.Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation.A possible value for this might be [4].#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs).A possible value for this might be [0.3].If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs).A possible value for this might be [0.3].If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed.A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed.A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells.A 
possible value for this might be [0].Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells.A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset.Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer.A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval.A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula : Spread ( integer ) - as per current Stack Manager<span type="person" start="1166380" end="1166386">Offset</span>( integer ) - as per current Stack Manager<span type="person" start="1166428" end="1166438">Suspension</span>( boolean ) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended .Normally "False"


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product.This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and<span type="person" start="1166807" end="1166827">Transaction Formulas</span>.Every time a<span type="person" start="1166844" end="1166855">Transaction</span>occurs , or a Dead Interval passes , the Criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program .If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR.If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum.If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly.Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

         INPUTS           OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  &gt;220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  &lt;30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  &lt;10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  &lt;4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  &gt;3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  &gt;5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  &gt;10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  &gt;15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  &gt;20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate.Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness.However , to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction , please see the attached : Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader , which will be similar to Stack Manager<span type="person" start="1169388" end="1169402">Garbage Checks</span>: Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price .The warning levels will trigger a pager message.The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended.The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price).There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g.gas is trading at $5.50.The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end).Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.<span type="person" start="1169940" end="1169957">Dave Message-ID</span>: &lt;5857915.1075857570449.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 13 Dec 2000 13:09:00 -0800 (PST)

front, they are also buying back summer.el paso large buyer of next winter 
today taking off spreads.certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong 
on the way up and such a piece now.really the only one left with any risk 
premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, 
down 40+ from this morning.certainly if we are entering a period of bearish 
to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.certainly understand the arguments 
for h/j.if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.H 20 call was 
trading for 55 on monday.today it was 10/17.the market's view of 
probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that

is this indistries abilty to keep a contango-we dont have that but they
certainly doing their best.for cash to be at huge premiums and cold weather 
up
front like we have nt had in years, 15 dollar ny, 50 socal, 10 buck hub-shit
whats it take, not like theres huge spec lenght left.i guess to the extent mkt is sooo concerned about running out in 
march-they
gonna keep a huge premium in whats left of the winter strip vs summer, and 
they
shud.cash loan deals have to keep hedged lenght in mar there fore makes em
strong so long as they stay way below ratchets.other thing worries me about

is cash tite but will steadily get some relief from switching, proocessing
margins negtive , dist, resid, nukes coming up, then on day we come in and 
they
say weather going above normal 1 st 10 days of jan... BAM guess they wack it.and yes apr/may i think is nuts, mar/apr i dont in part cuz apr whud be a 
dog.i
cant figure out how and when best way to short it/hedge my bet

  dont know-im leaving it alone, the cash makes it a jan/feb a compelling but
too many ifs, yes and dec/jan expirey, wud have thot cash wud recverse the

liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the 
plant, so that wouldn't help.Second, it seems there are more of these "portable pipeline" units floating 
around than I thought.Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas 
(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one.Moreover, PG&amp;E has 
one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento.Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack.The specs of that unit are 
about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic 
feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi.As I said 
yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the 
pipeline system in California.This information I got from<span type="person" start="1193603" end="1193613">Jeff Beale</span>, who runs CH-IV , a small-scale LNG consultant .He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that 
he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested 
in looking further into transporting LNG into California.Assuming that we could get a few "portable pipelines" and some trucks, there 
are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:

Location Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage 
(gal) Storage (mmcf)
Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2
LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2
Sacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8
LaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92      
Evanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2

Totals         26.48

Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question.The 
Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to 
providing methane for laboratory purposes.The others may have contracts with 
LNG fleet owners.I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting.Message-ID: &lt;15036793.1075857570828.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 11 Dec 2000 23:52:00 -0800 (PST)

&gt; In a statement, the college said the suspension followed an
&gt;investigation by the conference into "personal relationships" of
&gt;Rabbi Zimmerman, which it did not specify other than to say that
&gt;they predated his appointment as president in January 1996.Rabbi
&gt;Zimmerman was the seventh president of the college, which was
&gt;founded in 1875.&gt; &gt; Rabbi<span type="person" start="1197106" end="1197122">Paul J. Menitoff</span>, the conference 's executive vice president , &gt;said its board approved the penalty on Monday , based on a &gt;recommendation by its ethics committee , which looks into complaints &gt;about the conference 's 1,700 members .&gt; &gt; Rabbi<span type="person" start="1197344" end="1197352">Menitoff</span>said that conference rules prevented him from &gt;discussing the case but that the board decided Rabbi Zimmerman had &gt;violated a part of the ethics code , paragraph 2A , which deals with &gt;sexual conduct .&gt;
&gt; It is included in the section of the code on "personal
&gt;responsibility," which covers such matters as family life, personal
&gt;honesty and finances.It calls on rabbis "to be scrupulous in
&gt;avoiding even the appearance of sexual misconduct, whether by
&gt;taking advantage of our position with those weaker than ourselves
&gt;or dependent on us or succumbing to the temptations of willing
&gt;adults."&gt;
&gt; Hebrew Union, which trains men and women as rabbis and cantors and
&gt;in other graduate and professional fields, has 1,500 students on
&gt;campuses in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York and Jerusalem.Before
&gt;becoming president, Rabbi Zimmerman, 58, was senior rabbi of Temple
&gt;Emanu-El in Dallas from 1985 to 1995, and senior rabbi at Central
&gt;Synagogue in New York, from 1972 to 1985.He is married and has
&gt;four children.From 1993 to 1995, he was also the conference's
&gt;president.&gt;
&gt; Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was first reported yesterday in The
&gt;Cincinnati Enquirer and The Dallas Morning News.&gt;
&gt; Efforts to reach him through the college and its officials were
&gt;unsuccessful.The college said it appointed its provost ,<span type="person" start="1198676" end="1198682">Norman</span>&gt;Cohen , as acting president and would search for a permanent &gt;replacement .&gt; &gt; Rabbi<span type="person" start="1198768" end="1198776">Menitoff</span>said the conference followed " the same process that &gt;we 'd follow with any rabbi in the conference in similar &gt;circumstances . "He said complaints against a rabbi are referred to
&gt;and investigated by the ethics committee.Depending on that
&gt;committee's findings, the conference may dismiss the complaint,
&gt;privately reprimand or publicly censure a rabbi or suspendn or
&gt;expel a rabbi.&gt; &gt; Rabbi<span type="person" start="1199170" end="1199178">Menitoff</span>said the decision to suspend Rabbi Zimmerman was &gt;"very difficult and painful for everyone involved . "&gt; &gt; Rabbi<span type="person" start="1199291" end="1199305">Eric H. Yoffie</span>, president of the Union of American Hebrew &gt;Congregations , the Reform movement 's synagogue organization , said &gt;Rabbi Zimmerman did not contest the findings or the judgment &gt;against him but responded to the decision " with great dignity . "&gt; &gt; Rabbi<span type="person" start="1199553" end="1199559">Yoffie</span>said that during his tenure as president , Rabbi &gt;Zimmerman added younger scholars to the faculty and expanded the &gt;college 's Los Angeles branch so much that it will begin ordaining &gt;rabbis in 2002 .&gt; &gt; Another member of the conference , Rabbi<span type="person" start="1199802" end="1199804">A.</span><span type="person" start="1199805" end="1199816">James Rudin</span>, emeritus &gt;director of interreligious affairs at the American Jewish &gt;Committee , said Rabbi Zimmerman 's resignation was " a real loss " and &gt;" a shock to the movement . "&gt; &gt; Hebrew Union 's chairman ,<span type="person" start="1200012" end="1200025">Burton Lehman</span>, praised Rabbi Zimmerman as &gt;" a great , great leader . "Mr.<span type="person" start="1200084" end="1200090">Lehman</span>said that Rabbi Zimmerman 's &gt;resignation would "have an impact " but that the college was strong .&gt; &gt; " Transitionally , we 'll be fine , " Mr.<span type="person" start="1200229" end="1200235">Lehman</span>said ."We have a
&gt;strong faculty that will carry this institution through this
&gt;tribulation."&gt;

3. length and nature of "price discovery" windows past the NYMEX portion of
the gas curve (e.g., 7 years of visibility provided by proprietary market
making past NYMEX, then 10 years of macro / industry average assumptions).NYMEX price discovery equates to about 3 years.Liquidity of the market and

gulf expiring weak everyday.gas daily spread to prompt trading at 
$1....need some very cold weather to justify that.this seems to be the test 
of the next 3-5 days.Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management 
keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+.Not too 
many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.unless we get some crazy 
prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.funny watching the flies in the front.Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 
friday morning.probably worth 1.30 now.crazy.people have seen each 
front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas 
switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market

The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option 
for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets.There are a 
couple of reasons for this.First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only 
two plants capable of regasification.One serves Borrego Springs, a small, 
affluent desert community near San Diego.The other is dedicated to military 
and industrial supply near Sacramento.I spoke this morning to Applied LNG 
Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck 
fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts).It shouldn't be a surprise that I 
was not the first to call regarding this question.While ALT's fleet is 
operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and 
Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern 
California and Nevada, and Arizona.The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by 
ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and 
subsequent loading onto trucks.Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume.The 
average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into 
820,000 cubic feet.ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could 
deliver 18.8 mmcf.However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely 
transfer it into storage.The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would 
be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under 
repair).It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 
mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours).It has connections for two LNG trucks at a 
time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously.In the past, 
ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some 
reason.I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc.I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located 
peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage.Please let me know if you have specific questions.Message-ID: &lt;16358381.1075857570981.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 11 Dec 2000 03:58:00 -0800 (PST)

approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window:  the 9th, 10th, and 11th.I have input from<span type="person" start="1241948" end="1241959">Kim Godfrey</span>, who is driving things on the EBS side , and I have a tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th .I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) 
which each would be attending.For example, you would probably attend both 
days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&amp;2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, &amp; technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales &amp; 
marketing team.<span type="person" start="1245840" end="1245852">Larry Ciscon</span>may choose to attend both days due to the nature of his mission .++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.Thank you ,<span type="person" start="1246214" end="1246244">Jeff Jeff Youngflesh Director</span>, Business Development Global Strategic Sourcing Enron Corp. 333 Clay Street , 11th Floor Houston , TX 77002 t : 713-345-5968 f : 713-646-2450 c : 713-410-6716 ----- Forwarded by<span type="person" start="1246421" end="1246445">Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron</span>on 11/21/2000 03 :56 PM -----<span type="person" start="1246477" end="1246492">Jeff Youngflesh</span>11/21/2000 10:44 AM To : thadwhite@avaya.comcc : Subject : RE : Enron / Avaya meetings in Basking Ridge Thad , can you give<span type="person" start="1246629" end="1246636">Barbara</span>a "hold " on this until you and I get the people scheduled ?I have just returned from a day off, and don't

wide as last year.Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.if it 
couldn't do it this year....A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve 
told them to do last bid week.Obviously, more gas trying to come out than 
is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an 
Enron, to inject.Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling 
it out in G.When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, 
cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.Storage 
economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of 
winter.Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.storage boys 
are withdrawing today and buying that.bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it 
going to zero?

have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go.You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now.Attached is the URL for user to run the application.http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.comPlease feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application.Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com(or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today.If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users.Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet.Please contact<span type="person" start="1274006" end="1274019">Chrysti Hardy</span>to add their names into the group .(2) There is no new messages added yet.4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button.There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message.or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds.This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second.However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink.Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM.If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know.I can reset the time.Note: Right now the application is under test environment.If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.Let me know any feedbacks.Thanks,

Fangming

Haven't had the best of months.Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything.Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely.The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing.Something definitely out of whack.Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.Hell, already seeing it in the West.The system is just broken there.interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter.the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable.who would have thunk it.Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.continues to be a 
very trending market.most days finish on the intraday high or low.Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant.i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.understand they 
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.wait and see if it relieves some 
back pressure.very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 
considering the scenario that's being painted.slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/21/2000 01:06:40 PM

johnny, hope things re treating you well.this month has been frustrating for
me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled 
all
the rest.im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas
therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end.was 
long
mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early
  flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a
flaoor at 5.80-6.00bucks for another 40 days at least.if we have sustained
aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to 
mark
silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no
idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out.any
great insites?hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling dry up ? ?<span type="person" start="1285005" end="1285015">Message-ID</span>: &lt;10192882.1075857571968.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 21 Nov 2000 06:33:00 -0800 (PST)

generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data.WEFA gets 
around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data.After 1998, there were 
significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and

expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame.Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit.Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage.Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices.<span type="person" start="1296817" end="1296827">Mike Rabon</span>would like to speak with someone at Kinko 's about your storage strategy and growth .Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the

hubs.Interactive Video - Enron 's<span type="person" start="1297098" end="1297111">IPNet Connect</span>product will allow high quality H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K.Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network.<span type="person" start="1297490" end="1297500">Mike Rabon</span>would like to speak to the Video Conferencing product manager .Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be

unique deal.An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 
8th, 2000.It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1,Q86409.2,Q86409.3, and 
Q86409.4.These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore 
count as a total of four deals.We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as 
just one large deal with 4 different parts.Unfortunately,  the EOL 
Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals 
are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.Since this 
currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most 
conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.This results 
in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.<span type="person" start="1299201" end="1299213">Pete Berzins</span>x57597 Message-ID : &lt;5875735.1075857572185.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 14 Nov 2000 12:18:00 -0800 (PST)

Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the

looked like a good fit.It was an asset evaluation and integration job for
Enron North America: job # 0000105886.My primary strengths are:

Natural gas asset acquisition and management
Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and
derivatives execution
Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a
competitive reason to be     in the market, i.e. transportation spreads,
storage, physical presence
Good customer relations/account development
Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities
Stong negotiator

I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have
someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities.Where I am coming
from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is
doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every
trend imaginable in leveraging itself.I appreciate any help you can provide.Thanks.<span type="person" start="1304865" end="1304869">Alan</span>-----Original Message----- From : John.Arnold@enron.com [mailto:John.Arnold@enron.com ]Sent: Wednesday, November 08, 2000 5:15 PM

X-FileName: Jarnold.nsfThis was sent to me from my friend who works at the Home Depot corporate
office.&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The stupidity of some people in this world never fails to amaze me.&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  This picture is real - not doctored in anyway - and was taken last
week
&gt; &gt;&gt;in
&gt; &gt;&gt;  Waldorf, MD by a Transportation Supervisor for a company that
delivers
&gt; &gt;&gt;  building materials for 84 Lumber.When he saw it there in the
parking
&gt; &gt;&gt;lot
&gt; &gt;&gt;  of IHOP,  he went and bought a camera to take pictures.&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  The car is still running as can be witnessed by the exhaust.A
woman
is
&gt; &gt;&gt;  either asleep or otherwise out in the front seat passenger side.The
&gt; &gt;&gt;guy
&gt; &gt;&gt;  driving it was over jogging up and down on Rt. 925 in the
background.&gt; &gt;&gt;The
&gt; &gt;&gt;  witnesses said their physical state was OTHER than normal and the
police
&gt; &gt;&gt;  just shook their heads in amazement.The driver finally came back
after
&gt; &gt;&gt;  the police were there and was getting down at the back to cut the
'twine
&gt; &gt;&gt;  around the load.They told him to get back until it was taken
off.&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  The materials were loaded at Home Depot.Their store manager said
they
&gt; &gt;&gt;  had the customer sign a waiver!&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;    Both back tires are trashed.The back shocks were driven up
through
&gt; &gt;&gt;the
&gt; &gt;&gt;  floorboard.In the back seat are 10 bags, 80 lbs. each of
concrete.&gt; &gt;&gt;  On the roof is many 2X4s, 4X4s and OSB sheets of lumber.They
estimated
&gt; &gt;&gt;the
&gt; &gt;&gt;   load weight at 3000 lbs.The car is a VW Jetta with FL plates
and
the
&gt; &gt;&gt;guy
&gt; &gt;&gt;  said he was headed for Annapolis.&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;JUST UNBELIEVABLE!!!!

Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us 
which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual 
meetings?We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to 
choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the 
western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in 
NJ.<span type="person" start="1332768" end="1332780">Consequently</span>, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th of January , and got the final one to confirm late last week .However ,<span type="person" start="1332915" end="1332926">Kim Godfrey</span>at EBS may have some new requirements ; which is why I need your help in an expedited way - I 'll need to give<span type="person" start="1333037" end="1333040">Kim</span>your executives ' availability during that week , and then we 'll get things locked in ASAP.The meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day , from 2-4 hours of meeting time for the executives (VP &amp; up , primarily ) to discuss possible alignments and opportunities .This would include two primary areas : 1 ) EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use : what types of potential solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya 's internal use ; and 2 ) EBS &amp;<span type="person" start="1333578" end="1333583">Avaya</span>join together in a product and/or marketing effort to determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the ( common ) markets served : " sell with " ( each other ) ; and " sell through " ( channels type efforts ) , where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as sales channels for each other 's sales forces .These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would 
include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss 
areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value 
propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a 
go-to-market effort (item #2, above).In addition, the technical aspects of 
some of the 
"EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item 
#1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be 
addressed.Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for 
your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to 
Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days 
synchronized with your executives'.Thank you ,<span type="person" start="1334724" end="1334754">Jeff Jeff Youngflesh Director</span>, Business Development Global Strategic Sourcing Enron Corp. 333 Clay Street , 11th Floor Houston , TX 77002 t : 713-345-5968 f : 713-646-2450 c : 713-410-6716Message-ID : &lt;28242393.1075857572810.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 26 Oct 2000 02:21:00 -0700 (PDT)

acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore
3)  BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify 
what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works.4)  I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any 
of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided 
any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works &amp; EBS on 
11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for 
information relative to "what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation, 
Net Works?" from Net Works.5)  So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by 
Net Works) than will be discussed, because
6)  Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions.Period.7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net

&gt; certification methodology which is actually a two-phase approach.The
&gt; most critical phase, which ensures Win2K compatibility and support and
&gt; includes customer testing, has been completed.The Win2K Agents are GA
&gt; for both Control-M (scheduling) and Control-SA (security).&gt;
&gt; The next phase, which is also a key element of our development strategy,
&gt; is to insure the products meet the certification requirements for
&gt; Microsoft Win2K.This phase follows the Win2K initial release as MS
&gt; Certification focuses on meeting certain Microsoft standards and not the
&gt; application's functionality - ability to work correctly in the Control-M
&gt; environment.&gt;
&gt; Microsoft certification does not necessarily guarantee the performance of
&gt; the application.It is my understanding that one of the reasons Control-M
&gt; is being considered as a replacement for sys*Admiral is due to the
&gt; problems you are experiencing with their MS Certified release.&gt;
&gt; Earlier this year we met with Philippe Bibi and reviewed BMC's Win2K
&gt; Development Plans.Would it be helpful to set up a similar meeting with
&gt; an executive from our Product Marketing group to discuss these in more
&gt; detail?&gt;
&gt; One final note.I just received the following update from Rusty Cheves,
&gt; reconfirming that Control-M continues to run smoothly since we made the
&gt; database changes.&gt;
&gt;  Thanks Rob for all the hard work last week.It seems as we have
&gt; finally got this thing running smoothly.After extending the database and
&gt; troubleshooting which log files were filling up we now can eval till out

&gt;    &gt; Recap:
&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; There were 2 outstanding issues.&gt;    &gt; 1) New Day process running 2-5 hrs.&gt; &gt; 2 ) Jobs not running , they were all in Blue or<span type="person" start="1358586" end="1358591">White</span>status .&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Issue number 1 was resolved the day before I arrived by Tech Support &gt; &gt; working with<span type="person" start="1358703" end="1358708">Rusty</span>.Solution was to increase the Oracle DB from 50mg
&gt;    to
&gt;    &gt; 300mg.Also the log &amp; stat files were extremely small.These files &gt; were &gt; &gt; cleaned out by<span type="person" start="1358876" end="1358881">Rusty</span>, however were never increased or set to truncate &gt; in &gt; &gt; Oracle .They will fill up again.These files need to be set to
&gt;    truncate
&gt;    &gt; by the Oracle DBA or run a set of daily utilities to clean those
&gt;    files.&gt;    &gt; We will send a draft of those utilities to be incorporated into the
&gt;    daily
&gt;    &gt; schedule.&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; Issue number 2 - According to a diagnostic report the agent machine
&gt;    lost
&gt;    &gt; connection with the NIS server for a greater period of time than what
&gt;    the
&gt;    &gt; default settings were set.The agent is set to retry every 120
&gt;    seconds up
&gt;    &gt; to 12 times.After this period, manual activation is required.I
&gt;    signed
&gt;    &gt; on as CTMAGENT user and ran ag_menu.Ran option 2 which showed the
&gt;    NIS as
&gt;    &gt; down.I then signed on as the Control-M user and ran ctm_menu.&gt;<span type="person" start="1359726" end="1359734">Selected</span>&gt; &gt; 7 - Agent Status , Selected 2 - List all agent platforms unavailable .&gt;    &gt; Agent on BMC was in unavailable status.Next Selected option 3 -
&gt;    Change
&gt;    &gt; agent platform to Available status.After doing that, all the jobs
&gt;    turned
&gt;    &gt; to gray status and started running.&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; Cleaned up 2 erroneous agent names defined to Control-M/Server.&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; I also ran a Trouble Shooting Report which produced a file
&gt;    &gt; (/var/home/ctlm00/report.1116001128)  from this file we could tell
&gt;    when
&gt;    &gt; the Log filed filled up and when the Agent stopped.&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; I set up 500 jobs to run daily on BMC with multiple dependencies.&gt; All
&gt;    ran
&gt;    &gt; ok.&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; I set up aprox.another 150 cyclic jobs with dependencies to run on
&gt;    &gt; OCSDEV-1.They failed due to not using the correct Owner.<span type="person" start="1360576" end="1360581">Rusty</span>&gt; knows &gt; &gt; what the correct owner should be .I believed I used CTLM00.&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; New Day process ran for approx.12 mins.&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; Right before leaving Rusty ran a clean_db script, which resulted in
&gt;    &gt; cleaning out the entire database.Fortunately by design, we were
&gt; able
&gt;    to
&gt;    &gt; demonstrate the recoverability by uploading the tables from ECS to
&gt; the
&gt;    &gt; Control-M Server.In less than 5 minutes all was ok.&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; When I left there were approx.900 jobs running.Of those approx.&gt; 400
&gt;    &gt; jobs were running cyclic, every 2 minutes.Which meant on a daily
&gt;    basis
&gt;    &gt; approx.14,500 jobs ran per day.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<span type="person" start="1361253" end="1361258">Larry</span>, I know you asked for some type of hardware recommendations .&gt;    These
&gt;    &gt; is something that's very subjective.As with almost any software the
&gt;    more
&gt;    &gt; memory and faster CPU the better.To do this correctly, we should
&gt;    have
&gt;    &gt; our Professional Services come in and do some type of assessment of
&gt;    your
&gt;    &gt; environment and the direction your heading.How many jobs per day,
&gt;    today,
&gt;    &gt; near future, etc....  How many Users of ECS?  How many Servers?&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; In your test environment you should be able to run 2000 jobs without
&gt; a
&gt;    &gt; major problem.Your ECS NT box is on the small size, at least in the
&gt;    &gt; memory area.So your responses might not be as fast as desired.&gt;    Please
&gt;    &gt; remember the out of the box default settings are not tuned to run a
&gt;    large
&gt;    &gt; number of jobs.Therefore database tuning is always recommended.&gt;    These
&gt;    &gt; tuning recommendations are provided by Professional Services.&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; By tomorrow I will send you the daily utilities.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks , &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<span type="person" start="1362331" end="1362342">Ronnie Sapp</span>&gt; &gt; bmcsoftware &gt; &gt; INCONTROL Business Unit &gt; &gt; Software Consultant Manager &gt; &gt; West Region &gt; &gt; 972-934-5065 &gt; &gt; ronnie_sapp@bmc.com&gt;    &gt;

next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken 
care of.In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and 
CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well.It will settle against 
the Inside FERC indices for both locations.The term of the deal is from 
December, 2000 to December 2012.The volumes decline throughout the term from 
roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d.The average daily nominal volume is 
17,000 mmBtu/d.As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the 
producers' total volumes.I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with 
more details.There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to 
clarify.First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement.CSFB would like 
payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both 
the floating and fixed prices are known.As I understand it,  for the 
December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment 
would take place on February 15, 2000.Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. 
Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and 
Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we 
would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron 
Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million.(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've 
done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with 
the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with 
EnronCredit.com- which may be an issue for London rather than Houston.However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this 
transaction.CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split 
it among one or more counterparties.<span type="person" start="1365887" end="1365890">Per</span>,<span type="person" start="1365892" end="1365907">Caroline Abramo</span>, and I are meeting with<span type="person" start="1365933" end="1365937">Paul</span>tomorrow to discuss various credit issues , including this one .Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end

that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with 
existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it 
is for a small subset of the population.Furthermore, all applications must 
be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the 
desktops.As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to

Saturday.We are working on our release procedures and will make every

unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.Be confident.Answer the question asked.Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.The trading training program is still in the works.Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.Not sure about that last statement 
though.The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.Write me about how your interviews went.Good luck :<span type="person" start="1386357" end="1386377">John " Adam Bayer</span>" &lt;adam .r.bayer@vanderbilt .edu&gt; on 10/19/2000 03 :28:57 PM To : &lt;john .arnold@enron.com&gt;cc : Subject : How are you today Hi<span type="person" start="1386501" end="1386505">John</span>, How are you today ?You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers.Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program?You

Subject: Mexico Industrial


&gt; MIHC is a consulting firm with offices in Mexico City and
&gt; Los Angeles.We specialize in assisting foreign national
&gt; corporations with regard to their real estate interest in
&gt; Mexico.&gt;
&gt; Currently our M,xico City office is representing a client
  regarding the disposition of their surplus corporate assets in
country.&gt;
&gt; They have three properties which may be might be of
&gt; interest.&gt;
&gt; 1.Light to Heavy Industrial building in Tula, Hidalgo (a
&gt; well-populated industrial valley roughly 50 miles north of
&gt; Mexico City).Deluxe all brick and concrete building is
&gt; approximately 98,500 square feet with clear span ceiling
&gt; height in excess of 30 ft.The site includes adjacent land,
&gt; which would allow more than doubling the size of facility.&gt; Located in front of the PEMEX Hidalgo refinery /
&gt; petrochemical plant and a Thermoelectric power generating
&gt; station.Factory is equipment ready and could be in full
&gt; production quickly.&gt;
&gt; 2. Housing complex built for the Tula factory supervisory
&gt; personnel consists of 32 three-bedroom garden style
&gt; townhouse apartments and an independent eight bedroom
&gt; extended stay dormitory for engineers.In a separately
&gt; enclosed compound is a 3,800 square foot deluxe residence
&gt; with 4-car garage designed for the plant manager or visiting
&gt; officials.The property contains appropriate recreational
&gt; and sports areas for families.It is entirely gated and
&gt; fully secured.&gt;
&gt; 3. Development site City of Puebla.This highly visible 8.7
&gt; acres of flat land fronts the Puebla-Mexico City
&gt; superhighway at a formal exit.It is at the entrance corner
&gt; to an industrial area of other trans-national manufactures.&gt; Site is located approximately 5.5 miles north of the
&gt; Volkswagen assembly plant.&gt;
&gt; Prefer selling items 1 &amp; 2 as a package, but will entertain
&gt; separate offers.Would also consider long term lease with a
&gt; creditworthy corporate tenant.&gt;
&gt; With respect to item 3, a build to suit, again a
&gt; long-term lease with a credit worthy corporate tenant is
&gt; possible.&gt;
&gt; All properties are surplus assets and therefore very
&gt; aggressively priced.Factory and housing offered at
&gt; substantially below replacement cost.&gt;
&gt; For more information on these items and other services we
&gt; provide in Mexico please visit our web site.&gt;

game.Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back.No, of course not.But in 
crude, m/n at .10 back is normal.definitely a game as you try to keep month 
on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads 
and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.that's why cal 2 is as high as it is.when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt 
month.i can't remember w/o looking at charts.it's always the mentality 
of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter.i think that's 
why the winter spreads are a piece.the z/f/g fly is interesting.i think 
z/f can and will settle backw.just a high prob it goes cantango first.Still seeing sellside interest in term.definitely a result of pira.will 
probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them 
and watches the front of the curve.previous to that conference, the 
producers just didnt want to sell anything.tired of writing us a big check 
every month.so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so 
i can work at home at night.it's really my only time to sit and think 
without the phones and eol going crazy.they better pay me for the decline

along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me.i know
this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering
if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for
only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today.some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk 
too
they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing
deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be 
hard
to maintain unless we have crazy weather.we're only 2 weeks from withdrawel
period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds 
until
all the length bails.your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px
to make money,my approach in the short term as well.that said everyone at 
pira
including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a
win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap.fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on
natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad.for you 
be
careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too.there will
be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs
negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to
natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think.if i hear anything on 
oil
side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im
surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks
getting hit lately??
   good luck man-talk soon.pira was good.you go next year ill set up you 
some
interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up.by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short?non of my
biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more.inkjections next
summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.Message-ID: &lt;29244616.1075857573570.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 17 Oct 2000 11:59:00 -0700 (PDT)

I told you I have a long email address.I've decided what to prepare for dinner tomorrow.I hope you aren't

A couple of issues:

1.I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis 
child (grandchild).Is this not currently allowed by the system?

2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they

selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.Most 
selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.Pira certainly commands a lot of respect 
these days.Too much, probably.The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in 
natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March 
and run out of gas.The spread game is very different than playing crude.These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.You know there 
were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made 
a penny.Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?That seems hard to believe.slafontaine@globalp.com on 10/13/2000 09:42:43 AM

cmon give me some credit-you think ive been doing this this long w/out know
who's doing what!im i ny for the pira conference-thyre pretty bearish cal 01
and 02-will be interesting to see if/when the producers start to take that to
heart.here's one for you to think about... of pira's rite-ie production gonna
be up 1-1.5 bcf by year end.does increased deliverabilty mean these winter
sprds in producing areas-ie jan-apr and the fact the mkts gonna be more
concerened about running out in march than in jan suggest big invererese will
not be sustainable but will happen only on a weather event??? be curoius your
thots-i maybe thinking too much but makes some sense to me-have a good weekend
johnny.pira says decm 01 prod up 3 bcf y on y!

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&amp;2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, &amp; technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales &amp; 
marketing team.<span type="person" start="1429027" end="1429039">Larry Ciscon</span>may choose to attend both days due to the nature of his mission .++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.Thank you ,<span type="person" start="1429401" end="1429431">Jeff Jeff Youngflesh Director</span>, Business Development Global Strategic Sourcing Enron Corp. 333 Clay Street , 11th Floor Houston , TX 77002 t : 713-345-5968 f : 713-646-2450 c : 713-410-6716 ----- Forwarded by<span type="person" start="1429608" end="1429632">Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron</span>on 11/21/2000 03 :56 PM -----<span type="person" start="1429664" end="1429679">Jeff Youngflesh</span>11/21/2000 10:44 AM To : thadwhite@avaya.comcc : Subject : RE : Enron / Avaya meetings in Basking Ridge Thad , can you give<span type="person" start="1429816" end="1429823">Barbara</span>a "hold " on this until you and I get the people scheduled ?I have just returned from a day off, and don't

count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.Is this correct?Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.Regards ,<span type="person" start="1437372" end="1437376">Gary</span>x31511 Message-ID : &lt;18544570.1075857573981.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 12 Oct 2000 09:06:00 -0700 (PDT)

count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.Is this correct?Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.Regards ,<span type="person" start="1457957" end="1457961">Gary</span>x31511 Message-ID : &lt;20012653.1075857574329.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Fri, 6 Oct 2000 08:41:00 -0700 (PDT)

identical product.The fight is over which execution model is superior.I 
would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.It's 
happened in Europe already.The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the 
LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.Within weeks, 
the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.I 
still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals 
and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.<span type="person" start="1459242" end="1459257">John " Bayer</span>,<span type="person" start="1459259" end="1459268">Adam Ryan</span>" &lt;adam .r.bayer@vanderbilt .edu&gt; on 10/03/2000 01:23 :01 PM To : John.Arnold@enron.com cc : Subject : Thank you for dinner last night<span type="person" start="1459401" end="1459416">Dear Mr. Arnold</span>, It was nice to meet you yesterday at the information session .Thank you for the dinner last night.I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in
a more relaxed setting.During out conversation yesterday, I was confused
about a point you made.You stated that you spent most of
your time on the phone with Traders in New York.When
you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards
Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron
Online?I think the underlying question that I am asking,
is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,
or is it meant to bypass traders completely.Thanks again for your time and for dinner.I look forward
to talking with you again when you come to campus for
interviews.Cordially ,<span type="person" start="1460184" end="1460260">Adam ----------------------------------------------------------------- Bayer</span>,<span type="person" start="1460262" end="1460271">Adam Ryan</span>Vanderbilt University Email : adam .r.bayer@Vanderbilt.Edu Message-ID : &lt;30038366.1075849624792.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 4 Dec 2000 04:46:00 -0800 (PST)

* JEFF: In regards to the lunch charges, we charged a day guest rate
to include lunch in The Woodlands Dining Room @ $57.00 for  40 day
attendees.You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package.However,
when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box
lunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf.Thus, 80+40=120 - 100
(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The
Woodlands Dining Room.We billed you for the total amount of persons over
the 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms.Enron had a guarantee of
120 attendees.We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees.This particular
day, (5) breakouts were ordered.The audio visual in the additional
breakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.<span type="person" start="1483641" end="1483645">Jeff</span>, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as possible in order to remit for payment .Please feel free to call me should

extremely creative individual.Whalley actually commented on him today as 
someone "who thinks outside the box".<span type="person" start="1489461" end="1489465">Bill</span>actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth .He has been 
successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.He throws out 
ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.He pointed 
out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally 
don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for 
Enron.In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within 
reason.I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be 
considered a high priority.I am willing to accept some of the credit risk 
exposure as a cost of doing business.Bill understands his role as an 
independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for 
someone with finite capital.I place very high confidence in Bill not 
conducting high risk trades.Having said that, we certainly need to monitor 
his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.Just understand that he is 
at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade 
counterparty.I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread 
option he traded.He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the 
trading desk, knew it as well.There are a couple isolated products that 
Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.This 
was one product.Our spread options are booked in<span type="person" start="1491006" end="1491011">Excel</span>using option pricing models created by the research group .The problem with these models is that 
they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental 
price limitations.For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, 
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within 
variable cost than the models predict.Thus it is necessary to apply a 
correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.Obviously, 
we have this function in our pricing models.I was not aware this 
methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.This has since 
been changed.Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very 
few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to 
Enron.I gave<span type="person" start="1491878" end="1491888">Mike Maggi</span>the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit .I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade 
considering the circumstances.If you believe differently, please advise.Thanks,

$7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price 
curves proportionally shifted.Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the 
price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX 
volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.Key findings include:
$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%  
$9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% 

       

It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the 
financial desk actually decreased.This would seem to imply that up to the 
seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces 
risk).But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that 
the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and 
increasing VaR by 74%.Does this make sense or is something else happening?<span type="person" start="1519081" end="1519086">Frank</span>---------------------- Forwarded by<span type="person" start="1519129" end="1519152">Frank Hayden/Corp/Enron</span>on 09/15/2000 03:43 PM --------------------------- From : Sunil Dalal 09/15/2000 02:54 PM To :<span type="person" start="1519286" end="1519312">Vladimir Gorny/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>,<span type="person" start="1519314" end="1519343">Frank Hayden/Corp/Enron@Enron</span>cc : Subject : Lavo/Arnold Stresses Attached below are the $ 7 and $ 9 stresses that were run at the request of Lavo ( $ 7 ) and<span type="person" start="1519471" end="1519477">Arnold</span>( $ 9) .I ran the results against the AGG-IV portfolio.Message-ID: &lt;16738931.1075857575071.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 26 Sep 2000 12:23:00 -0700 (PDT)

session unless specified otherwise.2. Today<span type="person" start="1554454" end="1554458">Pete</span>had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size .When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000

quantity to be 15,000.3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.Thx,

maybe some for other customers.He indicated that his cost for clearing is 
$3.05 round turn.If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing 
ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher 
clearing rate and getting access to financing.This is a question I hope 
your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El 
Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long 
futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin

this could take a longer term to reach the necessary "critical status", due 
to the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlow 
generates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by sales 
of product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS network 
capacity.(a "sell-through" effect for EBS)

2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutions 
to Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption that 
a near-term solutions engagement would be desirable.NOTE:  this could 
accelerate to the necessary "critical status", bringing to EBS more solutions 
demand due to the addition of "sell-to".The "sell-through" effect would be 
present with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (a 
sales "channel"), as well as EBS "sell-to" BBI &amp; Pagosa for their own 
internal consumption of bandwidth.__ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ACTION ITEMS : 1 ) Bristol will provide<span type="person" start="1581745" end="1581752">Anthony</span>(<span type="person" start="1581754" end="1581758">Tony</span>) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Services the necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI 's ( Bristol 's parent co . )Info/Technology area.2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there would 
be value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability to 
execute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gas 
well-head).3 ) EBS (<span type="person" start="1582159" end="1582171">Tony Gilmore</span>) will begin working on the I/T discovery process , attempting to aggregate total Bandwidth demand : (usage patterns/volume/etc. ) at Bristol and/or Pagosa .3a )<span type="person" start="1582332" end="1582335">Per</span><span type="person" start="1582336" end="1582346">Rob Bender</span>,<span type="person" start="1582348" end="1582360">Tony Gilmore</span>should be contacting<span type="person" start="1582382" end="1582394">Al Freimeyer</span>( sp ? ) at Pagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches from well-to-vendor .<span type="person" start="1582492" end="1582495">Rob</span>provided<span type="person" start="1582505" end="1582512">Tony Al</span>'s telephone number on 12/1 .4 ) Enron GSS to contact<span type="person" start="1582567" end="1582576">Ron Smith</span>- waterSCADA.com - to investigate parallel opportunity ( gas / water analog ) .5)  EBS and BBI/Pagosa will begin (internal efforts) to figure out ways of

opportunity to review the  http://wells.pagosaenergy.comweb site and
look at aspects of the "demo" section.This is a very dynamic program
with changes, upgrades, and customization taking place all the time to
meet the individual needs of our customers.There may well be a good fit here as we are seeking ever faster means of
communication and will be requiring a substantial infrastructure not
only for communications but for data base hosting as well.While yet in
its infancy we have received very positive feedback and interest from
numerous oil and gas companies in the industry.An alliance with Enron
to help us on the road to becoming the "Microsoft" of oil and gas well
automation would be a very alluring prospect.I would like to keep a
dialog going between us to scope out areas of mutual benefit for our two
companies where such an alliance would make sense.I hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely ,<span type="person" start="1584299" end="1584309">Rob Bender</span>, President - PagosaEnergy .comrob@pagosaenergy.comMessage-ID: &lt;31552617.1075857575885.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 13 Sep 2000 07:56:00 -0700 (PDT)

dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.We will be tracking participation.CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.Message-ID: &lt;815013.1075857575995.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 7 Sep 2000 10:15:00 -0700 (PDT)

Subject: data standards


Dear AEDC Member,

One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena
is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.This
standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic
developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and
examining data.Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and
more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more
comparable than ever before.A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to
see how the data standards can be made to work for you.There are 25
tables in the standard presented in an excel format.The tabs at the
bottom of the page will access the additional tables.You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use
the services of ACN, the American Community Network.AEDC has entered into
a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for
the standards.ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the
standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate.It is your call as to which
approach works best for you.Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic
development profession.They should be of particular advantage to the many
areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't
received the consideration they deserve.The standards are a great way to
tell their story.If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for
notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the
standards and their use.<span type="person" start="1607713" end="1607729">Paul Lawler AEDC</span>- SSDSTF Datatables 97 June 00.xlsMessage-ID: &lt;29281115.1075857576235.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 31 Aug 2000 09:10:00 -0700 (PDT)

X-FileName: Jarnold.nsfThe Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.It is 
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.Chief of 
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.I run the 
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.Never been but 
heard it's beautiful.Next time you're in we'll go out.J<span type="person" start="1608691" end="1608708">Heather Robertson</span>&lt;hrobertson@hbk .com&gt; on 08/31/2000 01:20:05 PM To : John.Arnold@enron.com cc : Subject : RE :<span type="person" start="1608801" end="1608811">Young John</span>?What do you mean?I'm serious!So what Fortune article?I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo...I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e.YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.The best part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.I'm visiting friends in
Houston on Friday &amp; Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City on
Sat.night.No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.Are you going to be
around?I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!-----Original Message-----

agencies?Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should 
plan for?If so, how much and where?9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers,

how to address the ICE issue.His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we 
post 1/8 on ICE.If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server 
automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.If someone betters that to 2 bid, we 
immediately go 2.25 bid.So we are always the best market on ICE so long as 
it is not inside our EOL 2-way.Thus the only way our best market shows on 
ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25,at which point our 4/5 market 
gets shown.If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.Our proposal was 
that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.Think about which 
system you like better.Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will 
be implemented shortly.I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing 
a product this week.The purpose will be to communicate about the importance 
of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 
2-ways and killing the broker markets.Message-ID: &lt;24051747.1075857576623.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Sun, 27 Aug 2000 05:49:00 -0700 (PDT)

taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each 
ENA organization's records.Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually 
a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain 
this project and seek permission to perform the inventory.We'll then ask 
that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our 
working contact.The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with 
their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff.There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project.Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic 
records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule.Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention 
requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space.The Fileplan, 
once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility 
for it, and how long it must be maintained.Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink.Livelink is an 
imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and 
then use the "imaged" document viewable from your computer as the working 
copy.After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to 
offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements.During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic 
records.We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e.MSA, SAP, etc..The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we 
do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers.It's simply an 
interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.Thank you.Sara Bolken

might hope.In addition, you will find that the product/service category is 
"Hardware".I am not sure that is the " Bridge " which<span type="person" start="1656384" end="1656395">Kathy Shaps</span>is looking for the contract information ( if any ) on .That Bridge (<span type="person" start="1656466" end="1656471">Kathy</span>'s target , I believe ) is the one which EBS has done a deal with ( Bridge/Savvis/EBS , early summer '00 ; for WebFN)...Jeannette Busse &amp;<span type="person" start="1656606" end="1656619">Greg Reynolds</span>are intimately familiar with that customer relationship , but perhaps not at the contract level .If it is and EBS-only relationship, EBS

Please check the URLs above, and if they take you to the company with the 
"Enron relationship" you're referring to, I'll have a better idea what to 
look for.In the meantime, I am looking into our contracts area to see what, 
if any, contracts that GSS has active (for any part of Enron) with any

Strategic Sourcing, Portfolio Leader, who manages the Continental 
relationship.Enron Buy Side with Continental:

Current Enron US spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately $40 
million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.Enron Sell Side with Continental:

Additionally, Enron has a strong relationship with Continental's Fuel 
Management company.Specifically, Enron has been hedging Continental's crude 
oil over the past 2+ years.Value to Enron has been over $9 million; value 
to Continental has been over $45 million since 1999.Enron Global Markets is 
currently exploring several other business propositions with Continental 
Airlines in the following areas of financial risk management:  weather 
derivatives, plastics hedging, and on-line jet swaps.Enron Energy Services 
is exploring an energy (electric commodity) deal with Continental as well.Mr. Dyson, please don't hesitate to call if I can be of further assistance

initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August
24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go
live soon afterwards.While market transparency will increase as dealers used to over-the-counter ( OTC ) telephone-based market trade on a screen , users of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade ,<span type="person" start="1677483" end="1677499">Jeffrey Sprecher</span>, ICE 's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview ."As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both
counterparties," he said."The real strength is that you (still) get the
ability to manage your own counterparties."You can list all of the people you want to do business with and put
in the credit terms under which you will do business."This information will then be processed by what<span type="person" start="1677912" end="1677920">Sprecher</span>called a "giant matrix " within the system ."(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't sure
they have ever seen the entire market," he said."(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals you
can't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market."Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently aware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market transparency , as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who fall outside their own trading criteria ,<span type="person" start="1678465" end="1678473">Sprecher</span>said .The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock
and will be accessible via the public internet or a private network
connection.Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco &lt;BPA.L&gt; , Deutsche Bank &lt;DBKGn.DE&gt; , Goldman Sachs &lt;GS.N&gt; , Morgan<span type="person" start="1678760" end="1678779">Stanley Dean Witter</span>&lt;MWD.N&gt; , Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD.AS&gt;&lt;SHEL.L&gt; , Societe Generale &lt;SOGN.PA&gt; and TotalfinaElf &lt;TOTF.PA&gt; .Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operation
and Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominant
internationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and power
companies, American Electric Power &lt;AEP.N,&gt; Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy
&lt;UCU.N,&gt; Duke Energy &lt;DUK.N,&gt; El Paso Energy &lt;EPG.N&gt;, Reliant Energy
&lt;REI.N&gt; and Southern Company Energy Marketing &lt;SO.N&gt;.Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that
the founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will
face additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to
trade a minimum volume.TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING
   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believes
trading over the Internet could boost trading profits."The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a
paperless back office can really save a lot of money," he said.However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off given
that dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing
systems, as they do in current OTC systems.Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties will
receive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those
players' own risk management systems.But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own
clearing system."No one really knows how at the moment," Sprecher said."There might
be some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists
peer to peer."In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurred
except those associated with trading.Membership is open to any
commercial market participant.Each product will have its own published commission schedule, which
Sprecher assessed at "slightly below the best prices someone would pay
in the voice broker business".((London newsroom +44 20 7542 7930)

that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care 
whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we 
could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.)This still 
will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to 
reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed 
transaction.I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I 
would like to know.We will probably run into this issue with any platform we 
deal with for obvious anonymity reasons.I would really appreciate your 
thoughts/concerns.-Andy

There is one feature that has not been transferred to the new stack manager.When I sort by both counterparty and product at the bottom of the screen, the

expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame.Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit.Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage.Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices.<span type="person" start="1710670" end="1710680">Mike Rabon</span>would like to speak with someone at Kinko 's about your storage strategy and growth .Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the 
actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the 
hubs.Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality 
H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K.Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network.<span type="person" start="1711343" end="1711353">Mike Rabon</span>would like to speak to the Video Conferencing product manager .Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be 
communicated to the proper person.Message-ID: &lt;29374467.1075857577837.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 1 Aug 2000 04:33:00 -0700 (PDT)

such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how 
Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures 
were $200.The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, 
and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position 
currently.But in the winter that may change.Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the 
assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.Assuming we enter 
the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long 
cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&amp;l side.While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the 
payout probabilities may look like the following:

20%  $ -.05
40%     $ -.02
20% $ 0
19% $ .031% $ 1

him at about 6:35pm.I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities 
(Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).He gave me some good feedback, 
and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.The only thing 
I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on 
feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do 
the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW 
felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I 
can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this

opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the 
winter.A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection 
season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground.With the most recent AGA, those 
projections seem to be closer to 2.7.With supply of gas very inelastic to 
price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the 
equation.The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand 
(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies 
will be stored rather than burned.Each AGA number is another data point as 
to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a 
comfortable level in storage entering the winter.A low AGA number 
indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be 
a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting 
noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand 
equilibrium.We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.If we get two low injections, watch out.Enron North America Corp.From :<span type="person" start="1740225" end="1740237">Frank Hayden</span>@ ENRON 07/12/2000 04:39 PM To :<span type="person" start="1740299" end="1740322">John Arnold/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>cc : Subject : Market Opinion about AGA 's<span type="person" start="1740370" end="1740374">John</span>, I think the AGA 's are not as important to bulls as to bears .In the 
beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull 
case.The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under 
stored.I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change 
that expectation.However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of 
bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come 
from the physical market and weather.I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.Thanks ,<span type="person" start="1741010" end="1741033">Frank Message-ID</span>: &lt;32716032.1075857578336.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Fri, 14 Jul 2000 07:33:00 -0700 (PDT)

announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40.The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items.Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million.Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.`` Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in our other non-regulated segments produced these record results , '' said<span type="person" start="1746565" end="1746580">William A. Wise</span>, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy Corporation .``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999.Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000.The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment.Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999.Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels.Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999.The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000.Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger.Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d.During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999.Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.Telecom Update `` We have made substantial progress in the development of our telecommunications business , El Paso Global Networks , '' said<span type="person" start="1749667" end="1749682">William A. Wise</span>.`` Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses , we have named<span type="person" start="1749769" end="1749784">Greg G. Jenkins</span>, the current president of El Paso Merchant Energy , to head our telecommunications business .Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock.The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000.There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company.The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production.On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations.The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies.The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews.Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

the major counterparties to have unlimited credit on EOL, just as they have 
in normal trading.2.  As a corrallary, I am under the impression that when a trade fails 
because of credit, the counterparty does not get an explanatory error message

for all the locations.The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol 
curves from historical data.I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price 
curves for NG and 
all basis locations.I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below.And here are the VAR numbers 
based on these curves:

     5/30/00  5/31/00
AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000
AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761
AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685
AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225

You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers.I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which 
would give more weight to recent data.We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect 
backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.Tanya.<span type="person" start="1788321" end="1788332">John Arnold</span>06/07/2000 07 :40 AM To : Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/EC T@ECT cc : Subject : Tanya : On Friday I emailed a new vol curve to use for VAR testing .I was under the

candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR 
system.You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative 
basis,
jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a 
big
jump in VaR.This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet.Please, look
at column D.

The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:

 a. a bug in the code.We are working with the person in IT who wrote the
                     code to review it.b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in
                    the fwd vol curve will do it).One solution I can 
propose, is to develop for
                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to 
review the fwd vol curve
                    before it is posted.If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  
it can be smoothed.Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?<span type="person" start="1792456" end="1792474">Vince Message-ID</span>: &lt;17423173.1075857579056.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 31 May 2000 00:35:00 -0700 (PDT)

Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit 
confused by the question.In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.Market 
conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount 
of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very 
favorable.I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level.JohnMessage-ID: &lt;10652037.1075857579318.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 31 Dec 1979 16:00:00 -0800 (PST)

strikes.If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, 
making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 
cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller 
size than most people want to trade.If we restrict to strikes with a lower 
delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a 
market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the 
money.Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way 
wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.Thus if the front swap on EOL is 
4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 
3.75/4.75,100 up.In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a 
strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.Thus I anticipate 
having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles 
struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for 
what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying 
to rip people off.Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier 
for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more 
sense.It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.Whereas if 
someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to

The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to 
two factors.First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics

longer-term strategic positions.The large increase in position is a 
reflection of my view of the market.Second , a large customer transaction originated by<span type="person" start="1821712" end="1821725">Fred Lagrasta</span>'s group was transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning .Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's

would like to solicit your feedback on the report results.We have selected your NG price position for April 4, 2000 (POST-ID  753650) 
for the initial analysis.Attached in the excel file below you will find:

Analysis across the various forward months in your position 

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&amp;L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&amp;L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&amp;L


Summary of your Overall Position analysis

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&amp;L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&amp;L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&amp;L


Multiple Stress Analysis

The attached Word document demonstrates the multiple stress choices.I have 
included a tab in the excel file that demonstrates the theoretical P/L 
resulting from shifts in both volatility and underlying price.Please note that the percentage changes across the column headers are not in 
absolute terms (for example, if the ATM volatility in a given month is 40% 
and the stress is -10% then the analysis is performed under a volatility 
scenario of 36%)

replicate seasonal fundamentals.There are convincing arguments as to why 
the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.However, in the previous 
methodology they blew out.For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232while Cal 10 was .256.I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the 
summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months 
of July and August over time.The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for 
the month as well as for the year.These premiums are as follows:

Jan  -.008
Feb -.004
Mar -.001
Apr .002May .003Jun .004Jul .004Aug .004Sep .003Oct .002Nov -.003
Dec -.006These premiums start in Jan 2004
On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 
4/5 spread was marked at .0475.In the old methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375= 2.9965
Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475= 3.044In the new methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375- .008=2.9885
Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475-.008 = 3.028The only change in the formula is from:
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table
to
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month 
premium table

The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I 
change themMessage-ID: &lt;11467315.1075857579741.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 29 Mar 2000 10:44:00 -0800 (PST)

the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time.Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice.In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it.So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice.Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise.Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow."In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice.Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more.The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source.The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run.They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete.The trial run is expected to commence in June.The board of the Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director , K<span type="person" start="1852420" end="1852430">Wade Cline</span>, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit .At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill.The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated.The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron to suspend investments of 600 mln usd in Brazil energy sector

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the 
Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president 
and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying.Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of 
the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the 
construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to 
be invested in unit Elektro, it said."There are no clear regulations for the sector.Regulatory issues are holding 
back investments," JB Online quoted Gonzales as saying.Gonzales said the decision to suspend the investments may be reconsidered if 
the energy sector regulator Aneel establishes clearer regulations.mg/as

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation.Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement.In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system.The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said.SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation.The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction.Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity.And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts.Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction.Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern ,<span type="person" start="1856151" end="1856189">Williams Cos' Kern River Transmission</span>, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave Pipeline Co. , Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group , Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported.Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households.If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users.New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies.Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official.Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say.If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest.Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants.This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says.Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

Dow Jones International News

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E.Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday.Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai.Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%.Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai.The U.A.E.source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E.government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion.However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E.suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself.Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project.TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field.First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005.Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline.Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project.A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.-By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260;

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell
Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be
insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.`` Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by keeping its assets in Oregon , accountable solely to Oregonians , '' U.S. Representative<span type="person" start="1867097" end="1867110">Peter DeFazio</span>, a Democrat from Springfield , Oregon , said in a letter to Governor<span type="person" start="1867178" end="1867192">John Kitzhaber</span>.The governor is considering DeFazio 's proposal , said Kitzhaber spokesman<span type="person" start="1867272" end="1867283">Kevin Smith</span>.Last month ,<span type="person" start="1867302" end="1867321">Houston-based Enron</span>, the biggest energy trader , agreed to cancel the $ 3.1 billion sale of Portland General , a utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers , to Sierra Pacific Resources of Reno , Nevada .Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power
prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's
collapse.`` We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset portfolio because it 's a solid earnings performer , '' Enron spokeswoman<span type="person" start="1867771" end="1867782">Karen Denne</span>said .``If approached by a buyer who
recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.''She declined to
comment on a potential bid by Oregon.The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press
reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,
the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland
General.Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more
than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added
Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about
market power,'' he said.Bond Issue

     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using
the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said.The state
might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale
because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that
slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by
utilities.Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power
plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of
the Portland General purchase.Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this
year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-
earlier period.A megawatt hour can light 750 average California
homes for an hour.Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99.They've fallen 31
percent this year.Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09.Scottish Power rose 9
pence to 492 ($7) in London.Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing
information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million
($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a
unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,
changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include
trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating
gas-price indexes.Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August , Enron spokesman<span type="person" start="1870194" end="1870204">Eric Thode</span>said .NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90
percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline
to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the
cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.

to get the plant up and treating raw lake water.It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 
million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build.The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, 
and that caused the competitors to lower their prices.The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 
when the plant is working.And Montgomery Watson could be required to 
construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant 
expansion for $32 million.But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined.The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a 
short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds 
itself.The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay

Financial Times; May 15, 2001
By ROBIN ALLEN

		There are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or 
sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export 
scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region.Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is 
reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in 
which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent.However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of 
"selling" at least part of its shareholding.The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit 
from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf.The project was launched two years ago by<span type="person" start="1891346" end="1891355">Abu Dhabi</span>, the wealthiest of the United Arab Emirates , to promote energy security for the Gulf .But<span type="person" start="1891447" end="1891459">Abu Dhabiis</span>seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a large-scale project , especially in the early stages .Dolphin 's majority owner is UAE 's Offsets Group ( UOG) , an offshoot of<span type="person" start="1891730" end="1891740">Abu Dhabi</span>'s defence procurement industry .In March , Dolphin , a relative newcomer on<span type="person" start="1891816" end="1891825">Abu Dhabi</span>'s energy scene , signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar 's prolific North Field to<span type="person" start="1891979" end="1891988">Abu Dhabi</span>.Qatari gas is the source of<span type="person" start="1892021" end="1892030">Abu Dhabi</span>'s long-term energy strategy , and Enron 's role was to develop , at a profit , the downstream section , primarily to construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to<span type="person" start="1892196" end="1892205">Abu Dhabi</span>.Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but

JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)." If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD average ...savings to all ...customers would be about four trillion yen per year , " Enron Corp Vice President<span type="person" start="1893392" end="1893403">Steven Kean</span>told a seminar in Tokyo .Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation ,<span type="person" start="1893483" end="1893487">Kean</span>said that indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy resources were often blamed for Japan 's high electricity rates .But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates.A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy.Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market.Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998.These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said."The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California," 
Kean said.North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp.In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits.Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market.Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers.The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly.However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall.The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday.The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000.However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies." What happened in overseas ( power industries ) suggest that the liberalization in Japan would n't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly , " said<span type="person" start="1896415" end="1896427">Tatsuo Hatta</span>, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo .Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users." There is a large discrepancy ( in rates ) , and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization , "<span type="person" start="1896735" end="1896740">Hatta</span>said .He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized."If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity."<span type="person" start="1897068" end="1897079">Steven Kean</span>, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major , Enron Corp. ( ENE) , told the same seminar that Japan 's power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S.He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization.Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called "Reassessing Power 
Deregulation," which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron.Hatta of the University of Tokyo said "it's very wise" that Japan has begun 
the deregulation with the "bilateral supply, or trade" system under which 
suppliers and users clinch deals directly.Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial 
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - 
is opened to free competition.The government is to review the partial 
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation.Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and 
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power 
providers, Hatta said.Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation 
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates 
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs 
are levied on prices."There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices" nationwide, 
Hatta said.Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees 
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said.Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) 
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation.Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power 
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its 
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with "strong back-up" from the 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry."Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with 
power utilities to reduce (electricity costs).We have no choice but select 
independent power providers," Omuro said.-By Maki Aoto, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; maki.aoto@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.By<span type="person" start="1899545" end="1899558">Cameron Dueck</span>05/15/2001 Reuters English News Service ( C ) Reuters Limited 2001 .SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy 
giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign 
investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and 
bankers say.But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from 
country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity 
across Asia, they say.It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security 
offered by government payment guarantees." Independant power producers ( IPPs ) will see Enron and Dabhol as an illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging market , but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be adversely affected because of it , " said<span type="person" start="1900504" end="1900518">Philip Jackson</span>, a banker with JP Morgan Chase in Hong Kong .Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion 
power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills.MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by 
Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron.The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the 
$48.2 million outstanding.The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to 
MSEB if the dispute is not resolved.Local media reports earlier in May said 
Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere.Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal 
governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill.GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES 
Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk 
before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital 
expenditure.Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment.Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or 
even changes in market conditions.But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts 
said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient 
enough to back these agreements.Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in 
emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they 
said." Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they 're even more so , " said<span type="person" start="1902206" end="1902219">John Vautrain</span>, vice president at Purvin &amp; Gertz in Singapore ."If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad."<span type="person" start="1902323" end="1902335">Robert Booth</span>, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth , Australia , was more pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy away from emerging Asian nations ." Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to call in a government guarantee , "<span type="person" start="1902704" end="1902709">Booth</span>said .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report

MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is 
expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its 
choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas 
projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported.The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee 
overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't 
completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers."Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some 
time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with 
recommendations from the technical committee," the sources said, according to 
the newspaper.However, the oil council "might endorse some balances concerning the offers," 
the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further.Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be 
notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas 
projects.Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement.After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil 
companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each 
project.The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar 
Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil 
Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E).For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental

MUMBAI 
THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron 
refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the 
political force majeure.Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political 
force majeure clause.DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil 
its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond 
its control.MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political 
circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure."Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related 
security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our 
rights'," DPC had said.However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was 
uncalled for.For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events 
occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'.MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday.The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, 
which had been subjected to "concerted, deliberate and politically motivated 
actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which 
will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform 
obligations under PPA"."Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that 
the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for 
providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in 
protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights," the statement added.However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 
402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply 
electricity as per the agreement.MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 
and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on 
Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand.MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 
213 crore.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Saudi Supreme Petrol Council meeting to decide on huge gas project bids

RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings 
on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take 
a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday."The SPC has been 
discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and 
the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman 
al-Suhaibani told AFP. 
"It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final 
decision will be issued," added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon.The 
meetings began two weeks ago.A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his 
firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week."The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow.bin were 
told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early 
next week," the executive told AFP.The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with 
the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding 
for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said.The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal.The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment 
in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in 
the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the 
Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area.They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the 
world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment.US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid , as well as Chevron , Conocokilometres , ExxonMobil , Marathon ,<span type="person" start="1909288" end="1909296">Phillips</span>and Texaco have been shortlisted for the Saudi projects .Rounding out the list are European firms 
BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf.ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures.The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up 
petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants.The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out 
simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, 
the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the 
executive said.Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the 
current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven 
billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004.Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has 
proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic 
metres).-AFPCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Message-ID: &lt;20139517.1075857603345.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 15 May 2001 00:36:00 -0700 (PDT)

Thursday, December 14th.Serge has indicated his availability for a 2-hour block of time,
on the 13th in the afternoon.That meeting would be essentially
an executive overview and strategy session for the appropriate
Avaya executives and the Enron Broadband Services exec-
utives.The bulk of that meeting would be EBS' presentation
of their Value Proposition for the potential EBS/Avaya efforts.The second day would be for members of Avaya's engineering
and development organizations, and possibly marketing; to
have a full day to meet with the equivalent EBS team.Both
software/firmware and product platform-type of concepts would
be examined, and any other area in which EBS and Avaya
development folks felt that there were possible synergies for
a solution or solutions for the following 2 primary areas:

1)  "sell to":  EBS solutions to Avaya for internal use, and
2)  "sell through &amp; sell with":  EBS and Avaya possibly
developing a solution for bringing to market in a similar
fashion to the Avaya/Siebel Systems' efforts.By way of copying this to the EBS team, I am asking that
they will coordinate with me whom they would be sending,
and to make sure that the 13th/14th of December fit into
the appropriate calendars.If there are any Avaya questions related to development /engineering efforts , I would coordinate as well , and most likely route to<span type="person" start="1924896" end="1924908">Larry Ciscon</span>, or other EBS engineering/development executive( s ) , as appropriate .Thank you again for your help, and we look forward to the

that you would be able to take it to a higher level on our behalf.Up until a year ago American Express were based on the Wilton Site.They 
migrated to Newcastle (about 50 miles away)  and  migrated again some six 
months later to Edinburgh ( about 120 miles away).Each time they have moved 
the level of service we have received has deteriorated.Some six weeks ago we had a meeting with<span type="person" start="1927550" end="1927563">Lisa McKenzie</span>( Area Manager ) from the Edinburgh office , at which we detailed our concerns to her .She said 
that she valued our business and promised to take these concerns away and to 
rectify all problems.In reality nothing improved , to the extent that we had another meeting with<span type="person" start="1927838" end="1927850">George Blues</span>( Account manager ) last week , and informed him that we had not seen any changes for the better .We also told him that 
if things did not improve within the next six weeks, we would consider taking 
our business elsewhere.We have actually made contact with a local company 
and are using them in conjunction with Amex for the next six weeks.Typical problems are:-

Communications - trying to contact people in Edinburgh is difficult.Response when we do contact them is not forthcoming.Not being able to speak 
to the same person twice.Promises of return calls do not materialise.Invoices - difficulty in resolving disputes.Car Hire - not negotiating the best deal with regards to rates.We 
negotiated better rates with Avis ourselves.Hotel Bookings - not using Enrons preferential rates on hotels with reserved 
rooms.Rail Travel - lack of detail on tickets.We feel that they are paying lip service to what we are saying and making 
general excuses in the non performance of their obligations.We hope you can assist us in getting a better level of service than that 
which we are currently receiving.Regards

Lesley

available (or coming soon) that I feel would compliment the small/mid cap
and fixed income exposure you already have through Redwood, Sequoia, and
Willow.Quantitative Allocation, LLC: Integrates four quantitative investment models
to drive aggressive (and potentially leveraged) asset allocation decisions.Generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and
futures transactions.Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to
-175% of net assets.This is clearly different from the largely
non-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own.I would consider this to
be a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund with
a brain and on steroids - call me and I'll explain that comment in more
detail).Juniper Crossover Fund, LLC: Managed by OrbiMed Advisors, and focused on
global biotech and pharma.Up to 30% participation in private equity.This
could be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-class
manager.Tamarack International Fund, LLC: Long/short stock-picker fund focused on
the international mid-cap market.I feel this fund is very similar in style
to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the
international markets that you currently lack.This is a new fund and the
first closing will probably be in June.Of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not
constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests in
these funds.Please call me if you're interested in any of the strategies
outlined above, and I'll have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to
you.Thanks , &gt;<span type="person" start="1934614" end="1934630">Michael Gapinski</span>&gt; Account Vice President &gt; Emery Financial Group &gt; PaineWebber ,<span type="person" start="1934695" end="1934699">Inc.</span>&gt; 713-654-0365 &gt; 800-553-3119 x365 &gt; Fax : 713-654-1281 &gt; Cell : 281-435-0295 &gt; Notice Regarding Entry of Orders and Instructions : Please do not transmit orders and/or instructions regarding your PaineWebber account( s ) by e-mail .Orders and/or instructions

As Final Exams Begin, Power Is a Big Question

For final exams, prepared students pack extra pens, calculators, bottled 
water, granola bars.And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus 
this year, a flashlight.As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during 
California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 
31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts 
may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.''People here are used to interruptions , ''<span type="person" start="1940521" end="1940531">Sara Abbas</span>, 21 , a senior communications major , said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus .''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot.People 
have cut the power lines.They just reschedule.''In an e-mail message sent Wednesday , the executive vice chancellor ,<span type="person" start="1940820" end="1940833">Paul R. Gray</span>, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the disposition of their examinations once the exam has started . ''Among the 
options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a 
Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether.Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms 
have windows.'' In some classrooms , ''<span type="person" start="1941231" end="1941239">Mr. Gray</span>noted , ''students may have sufficient natural light . ''The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of 
California and California State University.The two systems are embroiled in 
a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in 
February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to 
the universities.For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy 
consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison.Though several medical centers and the<span type="person" start="1941823" end="1941828">Davis</span>, Los Angeles and Riverside campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the blackouts , the rest of the campuses have been put on alert .At Berkeley , the warning from<span type="person" start="1942017" end="1942025">Mr. Gray</span>only heightened pre-exam stress levels .''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because 
I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a 
sophomore majoring in political science.<span type="person" start="1942258" end="1942269">Aaron Chung</span>, a senior studying cognitive science , said it would be unfair to grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively , planning to return later with more care .'' The only thing I do n't have a problem with is if the professors give everyone A's , ''<span type="person" start="1942540" end="1942549">Mr. Chung</span>, 23 , said .''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.''<span type="person" start="1942624" end="1942641">Gary L.

BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year.But 
others are still lining up to put the boot in.Hours after the company 
announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry 
BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating.This 
thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans 
as well as making future working capital more expensive.The timing is odd.One of the two other main agencies presented with the same 
BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that 
change-of-rating clauses were not triggered.In the meantime, the market 
prices of BT debt have been rising.The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures 
the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February.Such 
costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, 
whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.Moody 's verdict is , however , peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the whims of<span type="person" start="1944437" end="1944450">Stephen Byers</span>and the UK competition authorities .Moody's will no 
doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a 
result.In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages 
had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to 
cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms.The Office of Fair Trading has 
reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts 
have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up.The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled 
is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking.But it appears 
to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too 
much, so prices should fall further.The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth 
business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum.This 
sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation.It must strengthen the 
resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the 
greater advantage of shareholders.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company ,<span type="person" start="1945607" end="1945611">Inc.</span>All Rights Reserved.OUTLOOK

Houston needs to think small about future technology

OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook 
readers.Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone 
mentions Houston?Time's up.Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random 
acts of highway closure.But how about something very, very small?While 
Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to 
start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature.As technology 
advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular 
scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power 
numerically).Its theories and practices give scientists the means to 
construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered 
matter.Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, 
you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford 
residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises.The possibilities give the works of science fiction author<span type="person" start="1946926" end="1946938">Ray Bradbury</span>a run for their money , and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories that could fit neatly on your desk .Cancer-destroying robots could roam a 
patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration.Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated.And all 
manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the 
environment and from a business process standpoint.Sound like science fiction?Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with 
fiction.A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a 
functional switch out of a single organic molecule.Discoveries such as these 
have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS 
(nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine.This technology would surely change the world.But it would especially affect 
Houston.Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's 
economic landscape.The chemical industry already has begun conducting 
research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds.And the energy industry, 
still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities 
of nanotech.This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic 
development.Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two 
separate fronts.First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; 
and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, 
nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent 
machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies).But too much 
technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet 
the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities.Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister 
to the north.The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of 
semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye 
on developments in small science.In March, a private-sector company donated 
$2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research.And 
a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of 
their own.This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion 
dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology.Houston has its 
own projects, but they receive far less publicity.Houston 's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on<span type="person" start="1949434" end="1949450">Rice University</span>'s grand Turks of academia .Pushing the envelope of academic excellence as usual ,<span type="person" start="1949533" end="1949537">Rice</span>'s heavyweight research barons continue to generate and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting technology .But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity 
and support than other less commercially significant disciplines.On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will 
converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends 
that will affect Houston's future.Will the keynote speakers (chief 
executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue 
of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its 
potential economic impact on the region?I certainly hope so.Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of 
Houston's economy.Each of these industry sectors could reap profound 
benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light.Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off.But it's 
going to become remarkably important sooner than we think.So while 
Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think 
small.Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to 
our city and its economic development.Drawing Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company ,<span type="person" start="1950821" end="1950825">Inc.</span>All Rights Reserved.A

A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation 
as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to 
transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base.The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated 
with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston 
must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to 
compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever 
they choose.Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn 
enrich the lives of every Houstonian." The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests of the community at large , " said<span type="person" start="1951819" end="1951836">Eugene H. Vaughan</span>, a money management executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston 's Future .A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force 
recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have 
discouraged meaningful land-use planning.It sketches a vision of Houston 20 
years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public 
education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and 
current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of 
successors.The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role 
in Houston's civic affairs should continue.But it suggests the models of 
business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined."Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of 
the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major 
corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of 
Houston," the report states."But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly 
diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter 
how benevolent those leaders might be."The center 's board includes top executives of some of Houston 's most successful and influential companies , including Enron Chairman<span type="person" start="1953202" end="1953209">Ken Lay</span>;<span type="person" start="1953211" end="1953222">Ned Holmes</span>, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc. ;<span type="person" start="1953276" end="1953287">James Royer</span>, president and CEO of Turner , Collie &amp; Braden Inc. ;<span type="person" start="1953341" end="1953354">William White</span>, president and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc. ; and<span type="person" start="1953400" end="1953411">Jim Kollaer</span>, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership .Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group 
is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf."They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool 
around with something that is ill-conceived," he said.<span type="person" start="1953745" end="1953760">Rice University</span>sociology professor<span type="person" start="1953781" end="1953798">Stephen Klineberg</span>, one of the experts who advised the task force that generated the report , agreed that the center 's work could be very influential ." This is the first time there 's been a systematic , coordinated effort on the part of the business community " to improve Houston 's quality of life ,<span type="person" start="1954082" end="1954091">Klineberg</span>said .The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a 
source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier 
business organization.But its role changed about two years ago , Vaughan said , when<span type="person" start="1954334" end="1954340">Holmes</span>became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region 's future .Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people 
representing a cross section of the business community.These 10-day, 
seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various 
guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston 
scenarios.<span type="person" start="1954778" end="1954794">James D. Calaway</span>, a member of the center 's board , said the details outlined in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative " and are not necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend .However, 
they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said.In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and 
decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop 
participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to 
the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power.Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air 
standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax 
rate increase.Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the 
gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a 
large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year 
hardship post on the way to something more desirable."Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system 
by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational 
resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region.This in turn 
leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in 
the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007.These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to 
state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school 
graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or 
technical training programs.The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they 
would be funded.Potential sources ,<span type="person" start="1956549" end="1956556">Calaway</span>said , include local , state and federal tax money , private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent on more traditional educational programs .In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's 
reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that 
hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically 
competitive.These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable 
city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and 
redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and 
public transport in corridors that delight the eye."Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate 
pedestrians.Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range 
of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing.The Main Street 
light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail 
lines extending in various directions.To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome 
their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt 
"new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city 
centers.Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the 
expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city."Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy."The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns 
its energy toward diversifying the economy.The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its 
business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises.Space, nanotechnology 
and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly 
become significant global players.The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements 
of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city 
in which to live and conduct business."Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees 
to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such 
as education and quality of life.Working groups then will be established to 
begin translating these ideas into policy, they said.Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce 
results as soon as possible."If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a 
low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway 
said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the 
nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute."We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure 
that we educate these kids for our future."Mugs : 1 .<span type="person" start="1959377" end="1959384">Ken Lay</span>( p .45 ) ; 2.<span type="person" start="1959397" end="1959407">Ned Holmes</span>( p .45 ) ; 3.<span type="person" start="1959420" end="1959431">James Royer</span>( p .45 ) ; 4 .<span type="person" start="1959445" end="1959456">Jim Kollaer</span>( p .45)

05/13/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided 
not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete 
construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol."It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into 
infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the 
board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the 
phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General 
Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each.However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, 
the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the 
completion of the project.DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus 
marking completion of the 2,184 MW project.DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in 
last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been 
able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity.The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 
65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global 
debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC 
after its completion.In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity 
shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders.(THROUGH ASIA PULSE) 13-05 2001

(Copyright 2001)

DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a 
project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East 
Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday.Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the 
Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE 
Offsets Group (UOG).Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between 
Qatar and Abu Dhabi."The profit margin for Enron would be low.At present, the Dolphin project is 
being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told 
MEED.Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported 
last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for 
constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as 
too high."There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to 
develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED."But whatever 
happens, we are staying."On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the 
project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic 
metres) of natural gas per day.Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the 
agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was 
inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999.According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price 
formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following 
"high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi".TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar 
project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), 
with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake.From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to 
Dubai and Oman.An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also 
planned, as part of a regional gas network.hc/rp

going to live on a boat."His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand 
until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure.On a recent evening ,<span type="person" start="1964117" end="1964122">Lober</span>stood on the bow of one of his four charter yachts , enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay ." This is what I love , "<span type="person" start="1964330" end="1964335">Lober</span>said , scanning a horizon dotted with distant boats ."The others are here to party, but this is it for me."The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against 
the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad 
executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party 
for a major customer.A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered 
among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white 
dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her 
neck.In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star 
Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment 
on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year.Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million 
in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics 
to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme.One guy recently plunked 
down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date.One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings.Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as 
regular on-board equipment."It's a bizarre business," Lober said."Nothing seems unusual anymore."Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner.His kitchen staff does the 
prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, 
transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive.The 
galley crew does the final cooking.Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its 
size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but 
Lober has hundreds of competitors locally."I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, 
drinking and party business," he said."People say there are two things 
you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant.I put a restaurant on 
a boat."Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 
30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and 
VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a 
limo does on land.Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the 
Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it.In other cases, waiters 
deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can 
seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake.Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water.His father owned a 
supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in 
Trinidad.He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business 
after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&amp;M 
Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981.But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat 
to providing exclusive entertainment on the water.In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of 
vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism 
or other entertainment.He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, 
researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take 
to float his idea.Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 
passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the 
notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay."I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five 
feet deep in places, he said.Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan."This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober 
said."They had no confidence."I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank 
and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and 
tell me what it needs,' " he said.Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research.During the week, 
he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a 
charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up.After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel 
Association's annual meeting.Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 
percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar 
engines on the boat.Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving 
drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. 
Clair.Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993.The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but 
it didn't prepare him for marketing."I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said."The first year, I spent 
$125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that 
he called "a total flop."Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as 
long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, 
he said.Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a 
time.Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, 
insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave 
once," he said.Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he 
got one: target marketing.He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the 
boat and set out to find more like them.He set his sights on the corporate 
client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today.Corporate 
customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy 
Mills mall." We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years , " said<span type="person" start="1970305" end="1970314">Ravi Lal</span>, director of ethylene division of Technip , based in San Dimas , Calif ."The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before.Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back."Business slowly began to build, and word spread.Lober added the 90-foot Star 
Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, 
the Lake Limo, last month.Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of 
waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina.While part of that land is still 
undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober 
adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future."We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the 
other boats," he said.After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting 
everything back into the business.The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate.But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers."We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they 
prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said.It's a lot of details.He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector 
screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that 
some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other 
locations on the Houston Ship Channel.If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath 
the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor 
causes the player to bounce.Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from 
the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations.They work with Star 
Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements 
for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a 
major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's 
stanchions into palm trees.And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats 
instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being 
honored at a recent floating awards banquet.Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back."They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first 
cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said."People love something 
different.We provide a different kind of party.If they do it once, they 
usually want to do it again."But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said.Customers have chartered 
boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards 
dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes.About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral.The recent 
corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company 
has chosen to have with Star Fleet.Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that 
Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are."It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he 
said."In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just 
one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston.Even in Clear Lake, 
there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can 
actually see the water.We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor.So people have to be reminded."He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford 
cruises, Lober said."Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare 
our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, 
country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said."And 
our food is gourmet quality.Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut 
corners."Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax 
and gratuities.Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his 
crew provide.And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with some of the extras they bring aboard , such as the squirt guns ,<span type="person" start="1974511" end="1974521">Mardi Gras</span>beads , Hula Hoops and limbo sticks ."We learn a lot from our customers," he said."We see what they do, take the 
best and give it back to them."Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's 
business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make 
their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out.The real 
opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three 
boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers 
moving from one boat to another.A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 
guests.But one boat can still do a lot of advertising.At the recent corporate party , Mae West joined the other revelers who were slinging<span type="person" start="1975260" end="1975270">Mardi Gras</span>beads at al fresco diners as Capt .<span type="person" start="1975306" end="1975317">Tony DeFore</span>edged Star Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront .They may not have known it, but they 
were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him.As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge 
under construction.When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - 
the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star 
Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment.It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from 
school years ago, Lober says.And he's going to live at the top.Photos: 1-2.Left: Star Gazer, first of the Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts,

THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the 
infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose 
of government support.Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private 
investments in this sector have failed to take off.Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about 
Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its 
promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole 
consumer for non-payment of bills.Policy makers and investors in the energy 
sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of 
this key industry.Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating 
new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health 
of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power 
plant developers.After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit 
only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in 
greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years.The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection 
are almost inbuilt into the system.For one, there is a general agreement 
that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution 
front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs.``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they 
are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say.But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms 
cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before 
they break even.The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron too says<span type="person" start="1978645" end="1978659">Sayonara India</span>, claim sources in the power industry .IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop 
by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it 
difficult for investors to take decisions.``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up 
for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for 
eight projects, of which only three have taken off.Of this the Enron project 
is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source.According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance 
Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health 
of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs 
have registered a negative turnover.Which is why the financing or 
escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero.According to Union power minister<span type="person" start="1979596" end="1979609">Suresh Prabhu</span>, the states are now responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results .But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield 
much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that 
can help this backbencher.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.India Power Min : New Power Deal With Enron Unit Possible By Himendra Kumar Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 05/12/2001 Dow Jones International News ( Copyright ( c ) 2001 , Dow Jones &amp; Company , Inc. ) NEW DELHI -( Dow Jones) - India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp. 's ( ENE ) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC 's dispute over payments be settled , the country 's federal Power Minister<span type="person" start="1980510" end="1980523">Suresh Prabhu</span>said .In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires ,<span type="person" start="1980581" end="1980587">Prabhu</span>said the very fact that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project .A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with 
representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another 
meeting May 23.Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours."I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first 
meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well.There 
has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the 
meeting.The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a 
meaningful dialogue.The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes , "<span type="person" start="1981350" end="1981356">Prabhu</span>said .Earlier this week , in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston , Enron Vice President<span type="person" start="1981455" end="1981466">John Ambler</span>however , said , " While we have constantly maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving issues , this ( Friday ) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract . "The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity 
from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 
billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs.A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, 
recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated.Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power.Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825)a kilowatt-hour 
for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers.The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial 
disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, 
failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills.The Godbole panel is 
working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of 
excess power to the federal government or its utilities.A restructuring of 
the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda.The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a 
revised agreement within a month.The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt 
naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity.Enron 
has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second 
phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity.The plant 
will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002.Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest 
shareholder.Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General 
Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.-By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427;

MUMBAI, May 11.OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee 
headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power 
Company.Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last 
night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away.Instead , Mr A.G. Karkhanis , former Executive Director , Industrial Development Bank of India , attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders , Mr Vinay<span type="person" start="1984241" end="1984250">Mohan Lal</span>, Energy Secretary , told reporters here after the meeting .When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are 
coming again on May 23.What does that mean?"Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, 
senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the 
State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the 
rebate slapped on DPC."Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by 
DPC to the centre-stage," the official said."The company has not mentioned a 
single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or 
the State.And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate 
in our letters to DPC," he said.Mr<span type="person" start="1985032" end="1985036">Wade</span><span type="person" start="1985037" end="1985042">Cline</span>,<span type="person" start="1985044" end="1985061">Managing Director</span>, Enron India , did not comment on whether the company would issue the preliminary termination notice .The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and 
Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their 
stand vis-a-vis Enron.They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB 
does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project.They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is 
learnt.MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it 
against the non-performance penalty.Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice 
issued by DPC and made its position clear.The board is of the opinion that 
DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the 
Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default.The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three 
arbitration notices served on it.It has said that since MSEB does not accept 
the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - 
leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay.The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to the conciliation notice from DPC. Today 's meeting was attended by Mr Cline , Mr<span type="person" start="1986397" end="1986401">Neil</span><span type="person" start="1986402" end="1986410">McGregor</span>, President , DPC , Mr Mukesh Tyagi , Vice-President , DPC , and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar , VP , DPC , and Mr Mohan Gurunath , Chief Financial Officer , DPC.Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and 
Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend.The next meeting is scheduled on 
May 23, Mr Lal said.Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and 
telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving 
Dabhol Power Company (DPC).The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general , Mr Harish<span type="person" start="1986998" end="1987003">Salve</span>'s candidature for the job .The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third 
conciliator is yet to be appointed.Dabhol Power Company had written to the 
Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable 
conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process.DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the 
substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three 
weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators.Soon after the 
conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force 
majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the 
project.Our Bureau

Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's 
motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor 
"I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can 
insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business 
community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale 
markets."-- U.S. REP.PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market , U.S. Rep.<span type="person" start="1990266" end="1990279">Peter DeFazio</span>declared Friday .Gov.<span type="person" start="1990303" end="1990317">John Kitzhaber</span>reacted politely and said he 'll explore the idea , but others said it 's a long shot because of political , financial and timing factors .Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to 
DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else.Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio 
said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and 
generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon."I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can 
insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business 
community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale 
markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore.PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and 
is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific 
Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month.Other possible 
buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp.While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders 
showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea." I appreciate his efforts , but I do n't think it 's the right idea at this time , " said House Speaker<span type="person" start="1991592" end="1991604">Mark Simmons</span>, R-Elgin .He said the state already 
has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and 
conservation.Senate President<span type="person" start="1991743" end="1991755">Gene Derfler</span>, R-Salem , said he 'd be willing to sit down and talk with DeFazio ."I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't 
plan to devote much work to the proposal.Derfler questioned whether state 
government could run a utility as efficiently as a business.DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits.State ownership 
would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway 
corporation such as ScottishPower.For PGE customers, state ownership would 
provide some protection and stability in electricity rates.It also would be 
a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back 
into the state's coffers.The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state.DeFazio said state Treasurer<span type="person" start="1992525" end="1992540">Randall Edwards</span>had told him the idea was "in the realm of possibility . "DeFazio 's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits , said<span type="person" start="1992674" end="1992684">Bob Jenks</span>, executive director of the Citizens ' Utility Board , which represents customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE.Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the 
utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville 
Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to 
publicly owned utilities.However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to 
buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity 
sales contracts that already are in place.And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't 
necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks 
said.In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned 
utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower.The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE , but outgoing PUC Chairman<span type="person" start="1993617" end="1993627">Ron Eachus</span>criticized DeFazio 's proposal , saying it had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly owned utilities .He also said it seemed designed to get political attention 
for DeFazio's potential candidacy." I think we 're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose schemes that are n't very well thought out , and this seems to be one of those , "<span type="person" start="1994017" end="1994023">Eachus</span>said .DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area 
issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to 
build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with 
his plan.You can reach<span type="person" start="1994284" end="1994294">Dave Hogan</span>at 503-221-8531 or by e-mail at davehogan@news .oregonian.com .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Congressman suggests state buy PGE

Copyright 2001.The Associated Press.All Rights Reserved.SALEM , Ore . ( AP ) - Congressman<span type="person" start="1994635" end="1994648">Peter DeFazio</span>on Friday proposed that the state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs .The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov.<span type="person" start="1994809" end="1994823">John Kitzhaber</span>, who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it .PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 
customers.DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many 
Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets."DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and 
have the utility operate as a public power entity.He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission 
rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources."While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be 
feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation.Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility.Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, 
citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political 
environment in the West.<span type="person" start="1995741" end="1995750">Kitzhaber</span>said he 's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private utility , as long as it would benefit consumers .DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public 
ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville 
Power Administration's hydropower.The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature." Thanks , but no thanks , " said House Speaker<span type="person" start="1996163" end="1996175">Mark Simmons</span>."Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said."We have a 
bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue."Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large 
businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating 
plants.Senate President<span type="person" start="1996488" end="1996500">Gene Derfler</span>did n't reject the idea , but said the Legislature does n't have enough time in the current session to take on a job like a utility purchase .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.Message-ID: &lt;28542290.1075857603706.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 14 May 2001 01:29:00 -0700 (PDT)

Saudis Set to Select Firms for Gas Projects

NEW YORK -- After more than two years of talks, Saudi Arabia is about to 
announce its choice of international oil companies for three huge natural-gas 
projects that will mark a reopening of the kingdom's energy sector to Western 
investment, a quarter century after it was nationalized.But the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early 
next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for 
the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion.It will be months before final agreements are signed." We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at the end of the year , or , hopefully , the first quarter of next year , " said Saudi Oil Minister<span type="person" start="1999281" end="1999290">Ali Naimi</span>in an interview last week .Saudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today 
to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal.In the following week, Saudi Arabia 
is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides 
of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects.By the 
end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are 
expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects.This will 
be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter, 
has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest 
reserves of natural gas.As with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound.All 
three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group 
and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the 
plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose 
environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas.The Ghawar project, 
known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in 
investment.Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast.The third project is in 
Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a 
southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates.The companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia , or who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil , Shell , BP , Chevron Corp. , TotalFinaElf SA , ENI SpA , Enron Corp. , Occidental Petroleum Corp. , Marathon Oil Canada Inc. , Conoco Inc. and<span type="person" start="2000993" end="2001001">Phillips</span>Petroleum Corp. -- to lead each project .But they all have their hopes." We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator " for the Shaybah project , said<span type="person" start="2001171" end="2001184">Archie Dunham</span>, Conoco 's chairman and chief executive .Since Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to 
the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues 
as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration 
and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as 
well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their 
investment.Soon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as 
the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals 
company Saudi Basic Industries Corp.

have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage 
a free exchange of ideas.The White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to

electricity."The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have

the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background 
and proposals.Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their 
priorities.At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist<span type="person" start="2004416" end="2004425">Karl Rove</span>and<span type="person" start="2004431" end="2004435">Bush</span>economic adviser<span type="person" start="2004453" end="2004466">Larry Lindsey</span>, nuclear energy executives tried to make sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over the past few years .At one point ,<span type="person" start="2004617" end="2004621">Rove</span>asked if anyone was looking to build a nuclear power plant .An executive with Exelon replied that his company was

one-page memo."Cheney spokeswoman<span type="person" start="2005489" end="2005510">Juleanna Glover Weiss</span>said the task force has been studying the California problem almost daily .At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in 
late April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined 
national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals." I thought the purpose was one , to reassure people in the coal industry that coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix , and essentially when the plan is unveiled that they 're going to be looking to people to help martial this through Congress , " said<span type="person" start="2006076" end="2006086">Bill Banig</span>, a lobbyist for the United Mineworkers Union .White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage 
lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was 
permissible under federal law.Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California 
Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca 
Mountain federal nuclear waste site.The vice president plans to meet with 
the renewable-energy industry this week.Enron ranked among<span type="person" start="2006595" end="2006599">Bush</span>'s top 10 presidential campaign contributors , giving more than $ 110,000 , and helped sponsor a $ 7 million party fund-raiser last month .The Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds 
of its $193,000 in contributions last year.Edison International, whose 
holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a 
major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to 
Democrats.Enron spokesman<span type="person" start="2007065" end="2007076">Mark Palmer</span>said<span type="person" start="2007082" end="2007088">Cheney</span>met with Enron executives because the power wholesaler is a respected member of the industry , not because it was a contributor .Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity 
transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new 
transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he 
said.<span type="person" start="2007436" end="2007444">Tom Kuhn</span>, the institute 's president , said it is " totally ludicrous " to think political donations played a role .<span type="person" start="2007550" end="2007556">Cheney</span>'s meeting with Edison board members , held at the institute 's invitation , lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes .<span type="person" start="2007664" end="2007670">Cheney</span>spoke about the task force process ,<span type="person" start="2007708" end="2007712">Kuhn</span>said .He said<span type="person" start="2007727" end="2007733">Cheney</span>'s remarks were consistent with the vice president 's public statements .Edison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built , including coal , natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power ,<span type="person" start="2007940" end="2007944">Kuhn</span>said .Democrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings , but<span type="person" start="2008026" end="2008032">Cheney</span>'s office responded by only listing broad categories and no names .That

White House Energy Task Force: 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud10.htmlCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.COMPANIES &amp; FINANCE UK: Independents drill deep to strike rich seams : A new generation of smaller oil companies is emerging ; a group that has discovered how to be competitive , writes<span type="person" start="2009256" end="2009268">David Buchan</span>: Financial Times ; May 14 , 2001 By DAVID BUCHAN The UK 's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number .But they can rightly say , echoing<span type="person" start="2009419" end="2009429">Mark Twain</span>'s words , that reports of their collective demise are exaggerated .Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed 
"independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing, 
believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating 
in the North Sea 30 years ago.After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo, 
there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left.Yet 
they amount to virtually the entire European E&amp;P sector: the only significant 
exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden.Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in 
the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to 
consortia with a local flavour.But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more 
free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the 
same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British 
Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil.Enterprise is the only UK independent 
that is more than a niche or regional player.As such its E&amp;P assets would be 
a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured 
interest in taking it over.As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based 
independents began to look elsewhere." Unlike US independents which have always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America , those in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the world " , says<span type="person" start="2011029" end="2011040">Mark Redway</span>of Teather and Greenwood .Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in 
the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union.One company, Ramco Energy, 
dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in 
the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m).Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into 
Russia and got stuck.While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because 
it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam 
operations.Another UK independent, JKX Oil &amp; Gas, went into Ukraine, a 
country notorious for non-payment of energy bills.With diplomatic help from<span type="person" start="2011758" end="2011768">Tony Blair</span>, the prime minister , JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob it of its Ukraine assets .Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia." Cairn Energy now has as big a stake in Bangladesh 's gas production as Shell , and it would be left , if Enron ( the US energy company ) were to quit India , as the biggest foreign player in India , " says<span type="person" start="2012129" end="2012138">Iain Reid</span>of UBS Warburg .Premier Oil is now a 
substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and 
Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore.But there are risks in these Asian ties.The obvious political one concerns 
Burma.Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its 
presence was helping the military regime.Premier refused, and said it would 
carry on.The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to 
Cairn.Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are 
"very dependent on the strength of the local economies".But then, Mr Redway 
is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in 
exploration rather than production.He therefore rates Fusion Oil &amp; Gas 
highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&amp;P sector".Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end.Its goal , according to<span type="person" start="2013109" end="2013118">Tom Cross</span>, chief executive , is to find oil and then swap exploration for production assets ."This avoids the expensive development 
stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on".Then at the other end 
of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil 
or Venture Production.<span type="person" start="2013421" end="2013433">Roy Franklin</span>, Paladin 's chief executive , makes no bones about his company 's scavenger strategy , spotting rich pickings overlooked by the majors .The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil 
price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and 
sellers.But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is 
this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is 
selling off.As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company 
with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not 
exploration.And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort 
Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years.This new 
generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one."Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value," 
says one executive.The other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock 
market." By focusing on production , the new companies are more predictable in terms of cash flow and earnings , " says<span type="person" start="2014560" end="2014573">Mike Wagstaff</span>, Venture 's finance director .Copyright : The Financial Times Limited News<span type="person" start="2014661" end="2014665">Bush</span>energy team covers all the bases<span type="person" start="2014699" end="2014713">Sharon Theimer</span>, Associated Press 05/14/2001 Chicago Tribune North Sports Final ; N 13 ( Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune ) The White House team developing a national energy plan has met with more than 130 interest groups , from environmentalists and unions often at odds with Republicans to major<span type="person" start="2015002" end="2015006">Bush</span>supporters .Vice President<span type="person" start="2015035" end="2015046">Dick Cheney</span>, Cabinet secretaries and others have solicited ideas behind closed doors , hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange of ideas .The White House has declined to provide names of participants even to

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.DOHA, May 14 (Reuters) - Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) may invite new foreign 
investors to join its project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates 
as U.S. Enron Corp looks set to bow out, industry sources said on Monday."New partners are a possibility," Khaldoun al-Mubarak, project manager for 
DEL, majority owned by the UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), told Reuters."But at the moment we are in the midst of finalising the formal (development 
and production sharing) agreement with Qatar which should be done by 
September at the latest."Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which 
outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5 
billion project.UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by 
France's TotalFinaElf and Enron."Enron is going through major global restructuring," Mubarak said."(But) 
they haven't officially notified us about their intention to pull out."Enron officials declined comment.Mubarak said interest in DEL was running high."Everyone is asking for a stake," he said.The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North 
Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas.UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and 
setting up production facilities.The remaining $ 1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up receiving terminals at Dubai 's<span type="person" start="2019368" end="2019377">Jebel Ali</span>and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi .First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.DUBAI, May 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is 
expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its 
multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with 
the negotiations said on Monday.The sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell 
as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's 
upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation 
in 1975.Signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place 
in early June, the sources said.The anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's 
gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its 
energy investment opening over two years ago.But the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas 
sector, the world's fourth biggest."The fiscal regime and regulatory details 
have not been developed," said one source.FINAL CUT 
Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential 
foreign investors revealed last summer.Those companies had been grouped 
under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah.For ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi 
Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the 
biggest slice of the projects, analysts said.Other industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company, 
was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in 
core venture 2 (Red Sea).Royal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the 
sources added.Both oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the 
kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said.ENERGY DRIVERS 
An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's 
landmark energy opening.And analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve 
those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low."Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity," a source said."The 
gas projects will show profits."But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and 
electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen.On paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for 
impressive growth.Domestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is 
forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade.Saudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's 
biggest, remains off limits.Even so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil, 
the kingdom's lifeblood."The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate 
objective," a regional analyst said."Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually 
they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the 
majors."The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the 
kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed 
by gas supplies, such as power and desalination.The following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects: 
Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP , 
TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI .Core venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- International oil companies vying for a stake in Saudi 
Arabia's downstream gas projects, expect to be notified soon on whether they 
have been selected to participate, industry sources in the kingdom said 
Monday.Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council is set to meet Tuesday and shortly 
after, announce its final selection for each of the three core ventures on 
offer, the sources said.The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with international oil companies on 
the Gas Initiative, submitted its proposals for consortium members and 
leaders to the country's Ministerial Council in April.These were then passed 
on to the SPC for final approval.Saudi Arabia 's Crown Prince<span type="person" start="2024471" end="2024479">Abdullah</span>, who heads the SPC , is in Bahrain Monday attending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders ' summit along with Saudi Arabia 's foreign minister , Saud<span type="person" start="2024625" end="2024634">Al Faisal</span>, who heads the gas negotiating committee .Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement.After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the 
past year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project.Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron 
Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1, 
the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development.For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, 
Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed.And for Core Venture 3 , the Shaybah area , Total Fina Elf , Conoco ,<span type="person" start="2025480" end="2025488">Phillips</span>Petroleum ( P) , Enron and Occidental , Exxon Mobil , Shell and Marathon Oil were listed .With all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and 
essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to 
lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after, 
industry sources said.Exxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture.The operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be 
responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which 
will lead to final deals probably by year end.Also, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's 
individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't 
finalized, sources said.The three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25 
billion.-By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714-331-4260;

RFID chip will help speed up business

THE combination of recently developed "stick-on" Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP) 
will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas 
industry.And Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning.Global management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice 
which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this 
idea locally.Global Energy Strategy Practice partner<span type="person" start="2027140" end="2027151">Paul Spence</span>said that applying this latest combined technology , car owners can fill up a petrol tank without resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card .Relevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and 
the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science 
fiction movie.This surreal development is made possible through the application of 
ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate 
with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence.Such technology is economically available today."There are technology 
suppliers who are offering these capabilities."The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry.Communications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals 
to restricted zones.In an interview in Petaling Jaya recently ,<span type="person" start="2028031" end="2028037">Spence</span>said : " A lot of my clients now are asking , whether that same technology can be used to restrict access into hazardous areas , plants or production sites ."Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant?There 
are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that." 
"Guru in the field" is another potential application where a combination of 
RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal 
computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site."An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype 
mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other 
side of the world."The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity 
markets is to lock them in tighter correlation."The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets 
are shortening within the energy industry.Enron which is the biggest oil 
trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives."Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and 
gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to 
remain connected to global markets.Caption: Lim ... connected.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.All Rights Reserved.India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation

MUMBAI, May 13.THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is 
expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15.While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power 
purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is 
expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, 
sources said.The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate 
with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon 
meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report."The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB," a source said."The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and 
transmission."While generation and transmission can be controlled by the 
State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm.Over 1.5 lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a<span type="person" start="2030472" end="2030476">Bill</span>to unbundle the board into three divisions - generation , transmission and distribution - due to fear of privatisation .MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to 
delay in payments and theft of power.The second part of the report is 
expected to address the problem in detail.Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: "...none of the 
solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in 
particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its 
distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report."The report is expected to "suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the 
interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of 
Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and 
safeguarded," according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the 
committee.The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr 
E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay 
Mohan Lal.The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of 
the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of 
negotiations with Enron.Archana Chaudhary

These are volatile times for world business.There are increasing jitters 
that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies.Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a 
bout of slightly lower growth.But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the 
region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP 
grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank.Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections.In fact, they view the 
prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign.Nearly 54 per 
cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest 
performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up 
the GDP at six per cent.There are others who hope that better agricultural 
performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard.However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from 
a lack of consumer confidence and investments.Very few economists expect to 
see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon.An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector.And, 
they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move.Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange 
reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian 
currency.Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of 
control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained.Since then, oil 
prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued.While a rate cut 
may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector, 
stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon.Rain, rain, come again 
For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP 
level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year." According to our assessment , we believe the Indian economy will grow by around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year , " says<span type="person" start="2034029" end="2034040">Chetan Ahya</span>, vice president at J M Morgan Stanley Securities .In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a 
subsequent drought in many parts of the country.For the second year in a 
row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent.It stood at 0.9 per cent 
compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year.While agriculture accounts for 
only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by 
economists." The performance of the agricultural sector is important because of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption side , " says<span type="person" start="2034632" end="2034647">Mohan Nagarajan</span>, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research Ltd ( CARE ) ."It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries," 
he adds.More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on 
agriculture for their livelihood." A good crop means that demand for everything , from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like tractors will pick up , " says<span type="person" start="2035028" end="2035037">Nagarajan</span>.Economists are hoping that a good 
monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent.In service of the economy 
Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services.India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to 
transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01.With growth 
weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this 
important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP.Most 
economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge 
slightly higher this year.But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that 
overall GDP holds at six per cent." Even if the agriculture and industry numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth , it will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent , " says<span type="person" start="2035904" end="2035913">Nagarajan</span>.Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and 
other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7 
per cent and is expected to maintain the pace.Road construction is tipped to 
show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking 
Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies.Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax 
reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more 
people to buy houses.Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services, 
says Morgan Stanley's Ahya."We are emerging as the services workshop of the 
world," he says.IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing, 
though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money 
spinners in the years ahead.The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment."The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth 
rate," says Ahya.For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100 
Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone.A good home show 
And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the 
gloom over its performance.Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest 
rates.Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy 
increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year.While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is 
that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent.The bank rate the rate at 
which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven 
per cent.Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale 
price index at a tame 5.84 per cent.With economists betting that oil prices 
will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to 
exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year.A cut could coax the 
industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on 
rural demand.Neighbours' envy 
And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact 
of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to 
remain relatively placid about global developments.That's because they are 
less dependent on the US for their own economic health.That is expected to 
shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian 
nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand.With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is 
clearly not export-driven.In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP 
comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the 
Philippines.Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports 
remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data.Exports raced ahead 20 
per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01.It was the second consecutive year of 
good exports growth.On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same 
period to Rs $49.1 billion.But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per 
cent to $34.2 billion.That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from 
$12.79 billion the previous year.Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American 
slump in demand.The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a 
quarter of its exports headed to that nation.Besides, by taking in nearly 70 
per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important 
software exports destination.Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living 
overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on 
India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic 
turbulence.For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill 
threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from 
invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to 
the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit.It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of 
Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to 
between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion.Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from 
$6.3 billion.Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression."They are still talking about growth.It is a decline in the growth rate and not an actual downturn itself , " points out<span type="person" start="2040576" end="2040585">John Band</span>, chief executive officer , ASK-Raymond James and Associates .And remittances look set to 
maintain their pace as well."Most remittances are still from Indians who 
live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment," 
says CARE's Nagarajan.Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months 
to December 2000.Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same 
period.Foreign institutions support 
Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too.Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's 
equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the 
whole of calendar 2000.Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it.In the past few months, 
investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and 
seeking cover in alternative investments.As they rejuggle their portfolios, 
some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say.Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see 
India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band.Yet some hesitation 
Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government 
opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including 
pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence.However, 
tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India.In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the 
previous year to $2.4 billion.Yet, China a market India is frequently 
compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in 
the same period.Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start 
investment in the country."It's a pittance and it probably will remain 
stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house.The reasons are not hard to find.Foreigners seeking to invest in India have 
many fences to cross.Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic 
infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often 
left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India.The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring 
concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power 
project in Dabhol in Maharashtra.After being forced to renegotiate a power 
supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines 
once again.This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay 
its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its 
commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation 
that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply 
pull out of the project altogether.A disturbing turn of events, since, till 
recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India.It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign 
investor to pull out of a project.Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had 
also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing 
endless bureaucratic hurdles.And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300 
million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly.Many 
international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up 
operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market.Now many are struggling to 
break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for 
success.That 's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors ,<span type="person" start="2044191" end="2044196">India</span>still remains a tough sell .Outlook 
With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six 
per cent.Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget 
could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy.Strong 
measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment.These 
are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run.The recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment, 
although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable.Still, every 
bit helps.The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to 
accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic 
powerhouse are to be realised.After all, for the second most populous nation 
in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still 
nowhere near the figure its size suggests.Acegas shares, potential for growth (Acegas, le potenzialita di crescita del

part for now.i think we more consolidate sideways choppy for a few sessions
but if the present  rate of injections continue the end users/utilties will
have to stop buying cuz of real phys limitations to take the gas into
storage.funds short but only 6% of open int and have covered later part of
last week.think vol comes in again too.ithink it sale 4.50 scale up-talked to some
others to o thinking it cant go below 4.00 so i actually think more the
suprise in the short term for a break of 4.00!! so who knows/cud work the
other way.agree-disappointed at lack of producer selling-we had one deal come thur
but its been worked for months so not price relevant.when are you in town next?-----Original Message-----

rules to a game:
You flip a coin.If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.however, each heads you get after the first you double your

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.You should be ready to defend your answer.Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.Indeed , the very viability of<span type="person" start="2080095" end="2080102">Company</span>T depends on the exploration outcome .If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.From all indications , Company T would be happy to be acquired by<span type="person" start="2081263" end="2081272">Company A</span>, provided it is at a profitable price .Moreover ,<span type="person" start="2081323" end="2081330">Company</span>T wishes to avoid , at all cost , the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm .You expect<span type="person" start="2081426" end="2081433">Company</span>T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in , then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press .Thus , you ( Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer , but<span type="person" start="2081720" end="2081727">Company</span>T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer .In addition ,<span type="person" start="2081817" end="2081824">Company</span>T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the ( per share ) value of the company under current management .Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?$______ per/share

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.You should be ready to defend your answer.Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.Indeed , the very viability of<span type="person" start="2095376" end="2095383">Company</span>T depends on the exploration outcome .If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.From all indications , Company T would be happy to be acquired by<span type="person" start="2096544" end="2096553">Company A</span>, provided it is at a profitable price .Moreover ,<span type="person" start="2096604" end="2096611">Company</span>T wishes to avoid , at all cost , the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm .You expect<span type="person" start="2096707" end="2096714">Company</span>T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in , then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press .Thus , you ( Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer , but<span type="person" start="2097001" end="2097008">Company</span>T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer .In addition ,<span type="person" start="2097098" end="2097105">Company</span>T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the ( per share ) value of the company under current management .Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?$______ per/share

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.You should be ready to defend your answer.Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.Indeed , the very viability of<span type="person" start="2103522" end="2103529">Company</span>T depends on the exploration outcome .If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.From all indications , Company T would be happy to be acquired by<span type="person" start="2104690" end="2104699">Company A</span>, provided it is at a profitable price .Moreover ,<span type="person" start="2104750" end="2104757">Company</span>T wishes to avoid , at all cost , the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm .You expect<span type="person" start="2104853" end="2104860">Company</span>T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in , then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press .Thus , you ( Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer , but<span type="person" start="2105147" end="2105154">Company</span>T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer .In addition ,<span type="person" start="2105244" end="2105251">Company</span>T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the ( per share ) value of the company under current management .Thus, if you offer $50/share, for

anything less than $50.As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?$______ per/share

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1.Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.2. Remote access to your mailbox.After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doeSubstitute "john.doe"with your first and last name, then click ENTER.You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.You should be ready to defend your answer.Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company

 In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.Indeed , the very viability of<span type="person" start="2140446" end="2140453">Company</span>T depends on the exploration outcome .If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either
management.If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,
and so on.The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price
they should offer for Company T's shares.This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.From all indications , Company T would be happy to be acquired by<span type="person" start="2141610" end="2141619">Company A</span>, provided it is at a profitable price .Moreover ,<span type="person" start="2141670" end="2141677">Company</span>T wishes to avoid , at all cost , the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm .You expect<span type="person" start="2141773" end="2141780">Company</span>T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in , then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press .Thus , you ( Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer , but<span type="person" start="2142063" end="2142070">Company</span>T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer .In addition ,<span type="person" start="2142160" end="2142167">Company</span>T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the ( per share ) value of the company under current management .Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?$______ per/share

Shankman, please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the 
attendees.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continental's crude oil.The relationship has been beneficial to both sides.As a result, since 1999 
Enron has made over $9 million and Continental has saved over $45 million.The purpose for the December 12th meeting is to address three initiatives in 
order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and 
(3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.Several new initiatives being proposed to Continental include the following : exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (<span type="person" start="2148117" end="2148130">Craig Breslau</span>, Originator ) transacting financial swaps on line (<span type="person" start="2148184" end="2148199">Larry Gagliardi</span>, Originator ) creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (<span type="person" start="2148279" end="2148290">Mark Tawney</span>and<span type="person" start="2148296" end="2148307">Gary Taylor</span>, Originators ) outsourcing Continental 's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these products with Enron (<span type="person" start="2148417" end="2148429">Alan Engberg</span>, Originator ) Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines :<span type="person" start="2148490" end="2148500">Ron Howard</span>, Vice President , Food Services<span type="person" start="2148532" end="2148545">Larry Kellner</span>, Chief Financial Officer<span type="person" start="2148571" end="2148584">Greg Hartford</span>, Vice President , Fuel Management Company<span type="person" start="2148626" end="2148637">Jeff Misner</span>, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative ) Meeting Attendees from Enron :<span type="person" start="2148711" end="2148724">Jeff Shankman</span>, President and COO , Enron Global Markets<span type="person" start="2148766" end="2148777">John Nowlan</span>, Vice President , Enron Global Markets<span type="person" start="2148816" end="2148829">Craig Breslau</span>, Vice President , Enron North America<span type="person" start="2148867" end="2148878">Mark Tawney</span>,<span type="person" start="2148880" end="2148888">Director</span>, Enron Global Markets (tentative ) DISCUSSION : ( Developed through conversations with<span type="person" start="2148976" end="2148988">Alan Engberg</span>,<span type="person" start="2148990" end="2149005">Larry Gagliardi</span>,<span type="person" start="2149007" end="2149019">Gary Taylor</span>,<span type="person" start="2149021" end="2149034">Craig Breslau</span>,<span type="person" start="2149036" end="2149048">Tracy Ramsey</span>and<span type="person" start="2149053" end="2149063">Lucy Ortiz</span>. )Enron Buy Side with Continental:

Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was 
approximately $40 million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six 
months of 2000.Enron Sell Side with Continental : ( 1 ) FUEL MANAGEMENT : Current Business : Over the past 2 years ,<span type="person" start="2149361" end="2149374">Craig Breslau</span>and others have been managing a strong relationship with<span type="person" start="2149433" end="2149446">Greg Hartford</span>, VP , Continental Fuel Management , hedging Continental 's crude oil .The first transaction was on 
January 14, 1998 -- a one month Forward on Kero.Since then, Enron has 
completed 29 transactions with two commodities:  KERO and Crude.Current 
business consists of three crude call options, settling in December 2000 
($31.00) and January, 2001 ($34.00 and $35.00)

Value to Enron: Enron has earned $9,682,084 (1999-October 6, 2000)

Value to Continental:  Continental has saved $45,001,744 (1999-October 6, 
2000)

Possible next steps:    (a) A transaction where Enron exchanges call options 
on crude oil for airline tickets.( b ) Financial jet swaps on line :<span type="person" start="2150113" end="2150128">Larry Gagliardi</span>has already spoken with<span type="person" start="2150154" end="2150166">Rick Pressly</span>,<span type="person" start="2150168" end="2150176">Director</span>, Continental Fuel Management , regarding financial jet swaps on line .At the time ,<span type="person" start="2150262" end="2150269">Pressly</span>was not interested in pursuing this product offering .Value to Continental for (b):  a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging 
with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge.Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multi-year options 
as well both with financial and physical jet fuel.Possible next steps : Would<span type="person" start="2150635" end="2150648">Larry Kellner</span>be interested in ( a ) or ( b ) ?Enron 
could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following 
locations such as the US Gulf Coast, New York harbor, the US West Coast, and 
Europe.(Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor).If so, Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Online 
identification number if Kellner's office wanted to review the product.(2) WEATHER DERIVATIVE  PRODUCT:

Business proposition:  Create a basket of weather related risks - such that 
aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from 
Enron to Continental.Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their 
annual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussing 
earnings.It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge 
for all of Continental's weather related exposure.However, it is not 
difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it.Continental has hubs in Houston, Newark, and Cleveland.The weather 
conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include - 
rainfall above certain amounts, snowfall above certain amounts, temperatures 
below freezing (de-icing costs), winds above a certain speed, etc.  

Value to us:  Create value by designing a basket of these risks.Value to them:  Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continental's exposure.Possible next steps:   Upper management would need to issue a directive to 
various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect 
the bottom line, how much they affect the bottom line, and then ask each 
group to attach a "confidence level" to each of their estimates - Continental 
could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted 
average of their exposure x their confidence level - or some portion thereof.Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following:

Clear exposure.Quantifiable.Clear exposure.Difficult to quantify
Potential exposure.Quantifiable
Potential exposure.Difficult to quantify

For each of the above categories, Enron would also need an indication of 
whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress 
historical weather data.Enron 's weather derivatives team could then sit down with<span type="person" start="2152978" end="2152989">Kirk Rummel</span>, Director and Airport Services Division Controller , and some of his team ( or others designated by Kellner ) and brainstorm about different types of weather that cause increased cost to Continental .(<span type="person" start="2153192" end="2153203">Gary Taylor</span>made a brief presentation to Rummel on November 6th ; no follow up action with Enron has taken place to date ) ( 3 ) PLASTICS : Business proposition :<span type="person" start="2153359" end="2153371">Alan Engberg</span>proposed that Continental outsource their antifreeze risk (ethylene glycol / propylene glycol ) and plastics ( high impact polystyrene , polyethylene ) by hedging those products with Enron .Value to Continental: Cost/Budget certainty (assuming a perfect hedge whereby 
their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) and 
associated reduction in volatility of cash flows

Value to Enron:  The value is approximately $2 million notional value if they 
hedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure.Since Continental 
has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, Engberg cannot comment 
on the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be much 
larger than $2 million.Possible next steps This proposition is being considered by<span type="person" start="2154160" end="2154170">Ron Howard</span>'s team at Continental .Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron.Enron could 
then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of 
outsourcing their commodity risk to Enron.Could a follow-up meeting with<span type="person" start="2154424" end="2154434">Ron Howard</span>'s team and<span type="person" start="2154446" end="2154459">Larry Kellner</span>'s designated contact be arranged to facilitate this process ?<span type="person" start="2154523" end="2154535">Alan Engberg</span>also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful and rewarding to both companies .<span type="person" start="2154713" end="2154723">David Port</span>is already (x-39823 ) looking at ways to outsource Enron 's expertise in this area .Continental could be a 
pioneer in the effort.Factors to model would
include jet fuel, natural gas, electricity, currency, interest rates, 
plastics, antifreeze, paper, and, metal.Message-ID: &lt;831944.1075857604735.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 10 May 2001 02:18:00 -0700 (PDT)

Offset to Last Trade functionality.<span type="person" start="2185472" end="2185475">The</span>simplified description is : It tracks two variables : Intensity( Speed ) and Bias ( Buy or Sell emphasis ) .As Intensity increases, the Spread increases.As Bias increases, the Offset increases.I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.<span type="person" start="2185721" end="2185737">Dave Program</span>Criteria The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to work with several criteria/inputs/definitions .These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells.Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow.Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation.A possible value for this might be [4].#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs).A possible value for this might be [0.3].If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs).A possible value for this might be [0.3].If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed.A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed.A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells.A 
possible value for this might be [0].Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells.A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset.Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer.A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval.A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.Program Outputs The program should output the following variables as a result of combining the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula : Spread ( integer ) - as per current Stack Manager<span type="person" start="2188514" end="2188520">Offset</span>( integer ) - as per current Stack Manager<span type="person" start="2188562" end="2188572">Suspension</span>( boolean ) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended .Normally "False"


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product.This relationship would be defined with Intensity Formulas and<span type="person" start="2188941" end="2188961">Transaction Formulas</span>.Every time a<span type="person" start="2188978" end="2188989">Transaction</span>occurs , or a Dead Interval passes , the Criteria will be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the program .If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR.If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum.If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly.Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.GUI/Formulas Example : Constants Intensity Factor : [4 ] Dead Interval : [240] Offset Reversion Ratio ( ORR ) : [0.3] Transaction Reversion Ratio ( TRR ) : [0.3] Spread Minimum [0.04 ] Spread Maximum [0.50] Offset Minimum [0 ] Offset Maximum [0.49] Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01] INPUTS OUTPUTS Intensity Formula Formula # Intensity Spread Offset Suspension S1 &gt;220 -0.01 n/a<span type="person" start="2190515" end="2190516">F</span>S2 &lt;30 +0.01 n/a<span type="person" start="2190537" end="2190538">F</span>S3 &lt;10 +0.02 n/a F Transaction Formula Formula # # Transactions Spread Offset Suspension V1 &lt;4 n/a -0.01 F V2 &gt;3 n/a +0.01 F V3 &gt;5 +0.01 +0.02<span type="person" start="2190697" end="2190698">F</span>V4 &gt;10 +0.02 +0.04<span type="person" start="2190721" end="2190722">F</span>V5 &gt;15 +0.04 +0.15<span type="person" start="2190745" end="2190746">F</span>V6 &gt;20 n/a n/a T Note that # Transactions would be # Buys or # Sells , as appropriate .Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness.However , to give some idea of how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular direction , please see the attached : Additional Features System Notifications There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader , which will be similar to Stack Manager<span type="person" start="2191522" end="2191536">Garbage Checks</span>: Warning and Failure levels for both Offset and Price .The warning levels will trigger a pager message.The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended.The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price).There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g.gas is trading at $5.50.The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end).Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.DaveMessage-ID: &lt;31734334.1075849625626.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Mon, 11 Dec 2000 01:21:00 -0800 (PST)

Enron.At this point, I am looking around for a rotation,

Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations.I am wondering if
you know some people in these areas who might be looking
for analysts.I have heard that traders work closely with

already proposed several individual deals.In addition to those we are
including some deals in which there has been an expressed interest so that
Enron can take advantage of the pricing that this partnership will bring to
you.The purpose of this e-mail is to give you a heads up on the acceleration of
timing that we have been directed to work towards and to let you know that
we have already agreed to bring our price down in order to make the price
more attractive to Enron.We would very much appreciate your help in
expediting the process of bringing this agreement to closure.In my next

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie.climb a mountain)?I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.4)  And any other ideas you have.In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.Regards

pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and

utility/producer outsourcing:

3rd Quarter

Peoples Energy Production Company
PEPC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples Energy/Chicago.Transaction 
consists of back-office, risk management and production management for their 
Production company.Currently performing due diligence and will be making proposal ( in conjunction with<span type="person" start="2227251" end="2227260">Jean Mrha</span>'s group ) .Total volume of 30,000 
MMbtu/d oil/gas equivalent for 3 years.50% probability for closure.4th Quarter

MGU-Michigan Gas Utilities
MGU is wholly owned subsidiary of Utilicorp.Transaction is a complete 
outsourcing for the utility (28 BCF/year) for a term of 3 years beginning 
October 2001.MGU will choose a singular counter-party to proceed to 
structure/negotiations in the next few weeks.We have received very positive 
feedback from MGU and place our success rate at &gt; 50%.Original transaction 
priced as Michigan Index trade, but effort was to determine their choice 
counterparty.Initial indications are that the final structure will consist 
of a basket of index Daily/FOM and fixed price.<span type="person" start="2227985" end="2228000">Russell Murrell</span>and I have been working closely with the decision makers at MGU to ensure success .SEMCO (Project Pluto)
Utility based in Port Huron, Michigan with sales load of approximately 37 
BCF/year.Portfolio currently outsourced to TransCanada (4/1/1999-3/31/2002) 
and has been extremely beneficial to SEMCO.TransCanada (See Gas Daily 
4/30/01) currently holds all fixed priced risk for load following and 
management at around $3.60 and SEMCO was the only Michigan utility who 
effectively managed the arrangements the Michigan utilities negotiated with 
their commission.Bids are due in August and a counterparty will be chosen 
3rd/4th quarter 2001 for a 3 year transaction commencing 4/1/2002.Visited their office with<span type="person" start="2228728" end="2228741">Sylvia Pollan</span>on 4/11 and our risk is removing the incumbent , TransCanada .SEMCO will be proposing a fixed price structure to 
Michigan commission.On MGU and SEMCO, the Michigan commission will play a significant role in 
dictating final structures.If Enron is not successful, these utilities will 
be managed by other 3rd parties and we will keep you abreast of structure 
outcomes.Thanx ,<span type="person" start="2229127" end="2229132">Laura</span><span type="person" start="2229141" end="2229173">John J Lavorato/ENRON@enronXgate</span>04/25/2001 05 :48 PM To :<span type="person" start="2229206" end="2229232">Jean Mrha/ENRON@enronXgate</span>,<span type="person" start="2229234" end="2229263">Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON</span>,<span type="person" start="2229265" end="2229296">Frank W Vickers/NA/Enron@Enron</span>,<span type="person" start="2229298" end="2229325">Laura Luce/Corp/Enron@Enron</span>cc :<span type="person" start="2229333" end="2229367">John Arnold/HOU/EC T@ECT Subject</span>:<span type="person" start="2229371" end="2229382">John Aronld</span>was curious about the outsourcing deals we were pursuing .Could

I think we should play hard ball with these guys.They want a great deal 
more business, and we are going to have to see something in return for us to 
pull this trigger this year or early next year.Lets have them help us find 
opportunity.Also -<span type="person" start="2243058" end="2243062">Gary</span>'s idea of longer term is a good one .Especially 
for a company of this size.Re Rex, all BW deals go through EBS so we are accountable for the BW 
opportunity.Couple things

1.Dale/Patrick - can you guys please get involved here.<span type="person" start="2243300" end="2243304">Gary</span>has done a good job bringing in a live deal .We need some focus to make it happen.2.

has sent the request to TXU yet.TXU generally will send out data within 1-2 
weeks of a request.It has now been 6 weeks since we asked Dell for the data.Assuming Charlie actually gets someone to send the data request to TXU, we 
should get something by the end of the year.Similarly, Continental has not yet sent over data that they were to request 
from HL&amp;P.I talked with someone in Mark's group on 12/4, and she indicated 
that they had the data, but their real estate group wanted to review it 
before they sent it to us.On this one also, it is unlikely that any 
transaction will get done in this calendar year.Please call if you have any questions.Message-ID: &lt;18589095.1075857605814.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Sun, 29 Apr 2001 12:45:00 -0700 (PDT)

are some of my thoughts on how it went.We met with<span type="person" start="2269827" end="2269832">Julia</span>in the morning -- went to CA 's Toronto office , where we made presentation on EBS.Later<span type="person" start="2269922" end="2269927">Julia</span>made a presentation on Computer Associates , their Sales manager talked about their " security suit of products " , we were given a demonstration of their UniCenter TNG software , and then taken to lunch .At lunch, we were joined by the President of Worldwide 
Online Corporation (a Canadian startup).About Computer Associates:
Computer Associates is a highly centralized organization run by its founders.The company is the third largest independent software manufacturing business 
in the world.It offers more then 800 software products.Like other companies in their space , their stock has taken a beating this year losing more then half its value ( Jan 00 : ~ $ 70 , now ~$ 27 )<span type="person" start="2270611" end="2270623">Julia Ruslys</span>, is part of their " Strategic Alliances " team -- their mandate is to manage : Strategic Business Alliances Development Partner Program eForce technology unit Analyst relations CA 's APPROACH Computer Associates sees EBS as a potential "development partner " .Their 
interest seems to be in a long-term alliance with EBS, where they can package 
their software with a bundled network offering (from EBS) for their clients.They claim that their main product UniCenter TNG has a 30% market share of IT 
infrastructure management market.It is a cutting software package that can 
manage all LANs or remote networks for an Enterprise.With a stunning graphic 
interface, the software can be configured to manage:
All networks within an Enterprise
Each computer connected to a node within the enterprise can be monitored and 
managed remotely (software installation etc.)
Their is a plethora of add-ons to the basic UniCenter package including some 
advanced "Asset Management" tools that can predict future utilization through 
a neural network architecture.She commented that with UniCenter TNG, our clients have "full control and 
flexibility over their whole network" EXCEPT  THEIR BANDWIDTH NEEDS.EBS's 
flexible and intelligent BOS, if integrated with UniCenter TNG, can provide 
an enterprise complete control over their IT infrastructure with exceptional 
flexibility.Similarly they have a keen interesting in developing and 
expanding their storage solutions.They seem to be interested in expanding their market opportunity and 
increasing revenues through increasing the number of "CA certifications" and 
joint selling initiatives.In other words, they would like EBS's network to 
be CA-certified by developing compatibility between UniCenter TNG and IPNet 
Connect.They currently have 1500 partners, including almost all top names in 
IT infrastructure space.EBS APPROACH CONVEYED
Although I think we have conveyed EBS's approach of "looking at specific 
quick and clear opportunities", CA does not seem like a lean-mean 
organization.Furthermore, the people that we met with, did not seem to have 
an appreciation of the financial structuring and risk management capabilities 
-- instead seemed to be disconnected with the corporate financial goals of 
their organization.For example , when<span type="person" start="2272935" end="2272945">Steve Dowd</span>talked about financial risk management tools , their sales manager started talking about how they help enterprises manage risk through their " security software packages . "WORLDWIDE ONLINE CORP.
Worldwide Online Corp. is a startup (with less then $2M revenues) that claims 
to have good connections with CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp.)They were in contact with<span type="person" start="2273313" end="2273322">Brad Sims</span>' group out of Portland .That group, at some point lost 
interest in Worldwide because Worldwide are looking for video streaming 
services.Being a start-up with no credit, it is understandable why they were 
abandoned by us.<span type="person" start="2273548" end="2273553">Steve</span>made it clear that he knows nothing about the deal and he may give<span type="person" start="2273622" end="2273626">Brad</span>a call .I personally do not see anything for us in the next 
two quarters or so even though the company has been promised many sports 
broadcast opportunities by CBC.It is interesting that Worldwide Online is a small client of CA.<span type="person" start="2273860" end="2273865">Julia</span>went out of her way to convince us to meet with Worldwide Online .At one point, I 
almost thought as if her main goal was to promote a dialogue between EBS and 
Worldwide online.NEXT STEPS :<span type="person" start="2274059" end="2274064">Steve</span>and I made it clear that it will be important for us to look at some specific short to medium-term opportunity with CA.<span type="person" start="2274186" end="2274191">Julia</span>is going to identify the people in her organization whom we can have constructive dialogue with regards to IP connectivity needs of CA ( their network infrastructure procurement team . )At the same time, we had to show an interest in bringing 
her team together with our product development people to see if any 
integration opportunities exist between UniCenter TNG and IPNet Connect 
BOS/Storage etc.

forms have been processed.The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions
will begin on April 24th.As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to
you in February, but I don't believe we got it back.Also, I'm concerned
about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds
available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review
concerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.I'm thinking we could
knock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge
funds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESS
manager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PM
tonight or tomorrow night.With regards to the marginable equity for naked
options question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?Thanks ,<span type="person" start="2279873" end="2279877">Mike</span>-----Original Message----- From : John.Arnold@enron.com [mailto:John.Arnold@enron.com ]Sent : Monday , April 16 , 2001 3:59 PM To : Gapinski ,<span type="person" start="2280016" end="2280031">Michael Subject</span>: RE : Receipt of Hedge Fund Information mike : just want to confirm you received my money and forms .also, checking to see if i am set up to sell naked calls on ENE.  may be

has been crossed off the contract.That is the name it was signed under and

early).SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng

I think prices stay high through June.The big drop off come some where in

question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of 
correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are 
three big reasons for skew.one is that the assumption of stochastic 
volatility as a function of price level gets violated.commodities tend to 
have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and 
elasticity of the demand curve.nat gas tends to be relatively stable when 
we are in that historical pricing environment.however, moving to a 
different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.an options trader wants 
to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the 
range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.supports a 
vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a 
function of price level.nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at 
$4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.thus there has been a tendency for all 
calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative 
skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off 
in a declining market and increase in a rising market.to test, regress 15 
day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution 
predicts.supports vol smile theory.easy to test how your market compares 
by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected 
distribution.third, is just supply and demand.in a market where spec players are 
bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance 
premium to add incremetal risk to the book.if you have a neutral view 
towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly 
fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more 
expensive insurance.crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak

helped me hold on to natgas shit p&amp;l. got most of it back now tho.trying to be
more patient.think we hold 5.20's  for another week or so-must be plenty chopped up
traders mite mean we lose some momentum for a bit.what the hell was going on today between you and bo(seems i see this more

In our meeting on the 17th of November, the NetWorks team explained their 
position(s) relative to possible upcoming purchases of software, in which BMC 
might be selected as the vendor.There were several issues and concerns 
which were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimal 
application capability (that is the "net", understated version).<span type="person" start="2417785" end="2417788">Bob</span>, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what , if anything , BMC could do to "fix their problem" .I relayed the gist of our brief 
conversation to EBS.As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a deal 
done with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.One 
of the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMC 
for a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.Per a 
voicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for either 
November 30th, or December 1st.The purpose is to get an update from the 
NetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBS 
to explain what BMC has proposed.This meeting should take an hour.Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow or Friday.I'll book a room and 
time that works for the majority, and confirm with a Notes "Meeting 
Invitation".Thank you ,<span type="person" start="2418814" end="2418845">Jeff Jeff Youngflesh Director</span>, Business Development Global Strategic Sourcing Enron Corp. 333 Clay Street , 11th Floor Houston , TX 77002 t : 713-345-5968 f : 713-646-2450 c : 713-410-6716Message-ID : &lt;9713597.1075849625935.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 12 Dec 2000 05:56:00 -0800 (PST)

Jen and Paula are definitely going to NYC for the long weekend.Think
about what you want to do, and I'll call you tonight to discuss:

Do you want to spend the long weekend with me or do your own thing?If you want to spend it with me, would you rather go to the beach or
to NYC?

loss of demand, which is in the first 4 inj numbers.customer buying and 
fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level.if my theory holds, 
eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes.second 
puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4-5% on y/y basis, 
demand still weak (economic weakness isn't a 3 month problem), industry 
realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you 
should, and early winter weather will not match 2000.we develop large y/y 
surplus in x and z.  z futures hold up because some risk premium still exists 
for rest of winter.by late december, just trying to find a home for gas.think decent chance f futures finish with a 2 handle.slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/25/2001 08:16:26 PM

Warming Up To Green

BY ERIC ROSTON

Breathe in.Hold it.Hold it.O.K., now breathe out.Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are you
can't see
your breath.And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin
box for the
right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs.Yet last November ,<span type="person" start="2435392" end="2435408">Murphy Oil Corp.</span>, based in El Dorado ,<span type="person" start="2435430" end="2435434">Ark.</span>, voluntarily shelled out several hundred thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide , the same stuff you exhaled three sentences ago .The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that
same autumn
day, half a world away, at the Hague.Thousands of policymakers and
scientists
from all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross the
zeds and
umlaut the o's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. Framework
Convention on
Climate Change.The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission
of six
gases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geological
terms--turning the earth into a hothouse.But no final accord was
reached.In this context ,<span type="person" start="2436147" end="2436153">Murphy</span>'s purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of carbon ( the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars ) from a Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target seems a bit odd .The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, and
there isn't
even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued.Indeed
there
isn't even unanimity on global warming itself.Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an
environmental
transition.Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and global
bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions
trading
system.But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning to
confront the
climate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity.<span type="person" start="2436946" end="2436957">John Browne</span>, CEO of BP Amoco , and<span type="person" start="2436980" end="2436997">Mark Moody-Stuart</span>, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell Group , have both responded to the global-warming threat and set up internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto .Shell and BP have
vowed
to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyoto
target--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010." This is n't an act of altruism , " says<span type="person" start="2437319" end="2437331">Aidan Murphy</span>of Shell ."It's a fundamental strategic issue for our business."And not theirs alone.A growing number of corporations, from IBM to your
neighborhood Kinko's, are reducing their greenhouse footprints.DuPont
is
pledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010." There 's been a shift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community since Kyoto , " says<span type="person" start="2437706" end="2437717">Alden Meyer</span>of the Union of Concerned Scientists ."Now the view is that
climate
change is serious and we ought to do something about it."There are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sources
and "cap
and trade" emissions.That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas
emission
and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their
allowance or
buy credits if they exceed permitted levels.The theory is that the
pursuit of
greenbacks will fuel greener business." Whenever you turn a pollution cut into a financial asset , " says<span type="person" start="2438273" end="2438287">Joseph Goffman</span>, an attorney at Environmental Defense , "people go out and make lots of pollution cuts . "Even where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewing
the
potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to
consider.Witness<span type="person" start="2438533" end="2438549">Claiborne Deming</span>,<span type="person" start="2438551" end="2438557">Murphy</span>'s CEO , who does n't see the science of global warming as solid enough yet to cry havoc.But Deming hears shareholders
clamoring and
the bureaucrats buzzing.Someone may ask his company to put more than a
quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted
amount of CO2.Breathe in.Hold it.You know the drill.How much CO2 did you just exhale?Tricky question.Yet that's analogous
to the
one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale.Until they figure
it out,
companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) how
you
buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2)
how to do
so when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right."It's risky as
hell," says
Deming.Many groups are working to mitigate that risk.The World Resources
Institute
and others are road-testing a system that would make trading less risky
by
creating universal carbon-accounting practices.And four
companies--Arthur
Andersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re--are developing an
exchange
where companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid of
legislative
standards." They 're trying to nail down something that will be useful under laws that are not yet defined , " says<span type="person" start="2439793" end="2439805">Garth Edward</span>, a broker at Natsource , an energy-trading firm .The U.S. struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the Kyoto
Protocol,
and achieved it by agreeing to a tough, many say impossible, target:
bringing
emissions 7% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012.The irony of the
current
situation is that the Europeans, reluctant to accept trading at first,
have become
its champion; Britain next month will become the first country to embark
on a
national trading system.Another practice, still hotly debated, is to assign credits for
sequestering carbon
in growing forests.Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2, release oxygen
into the
air and turn carbon into wood.The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification , thus setting up an early environmental test for President<span type="person" start="2440596" end="2440600">Bush</span>, who campaigned against the document .But Secretary of State<span type="person" start="2440662" end="2440674">Colin Powell</span>has already heard preliminary briefings on the matter as the U.S. preps for the next round of talks , to be held in Bonn in mid-July .<span type="person" start="2440808" end="2440812">Bush</span>the First helped pioneer credit trading in 1990 , when he signed legislation that capped power plants ' sulfur dioxide emissions--the main ingredient in acid rain--but allowed the plants to swap credits .And Houston-based Enron , an energy trader whose chairman ,<span type="person" start="2441073" end="2441080">Ken Lay</span>, was a prominent W. campaign adviser , stands to be a huge player in any such market .So if it 's good for business ,<span type="person" start="2441196" end="2441200">Bush</span>the ex-businessman wo n't need that big a push .With him or without him, the monetization of carbon emissions--green for
greed's sake, if nothing else--is gaining momentum.So breathe easy.For
you, it's
still free.But for many companies, the carbon meter will be running
soon.In the
very near future, pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an
opportunity.Message-ID: &lt;22084880.1075857608569.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Fri, 23 Mar 2001 03:00:00 -0800 (PST)

anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman.Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&amp;reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&amp;rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=

limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&amp;A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=

o=20
the same.For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20

discount structure to Enron to a 45%-off pricing level, if EBS and Enron 
aggregate their spend opportunity.This should come as good news to anyone 
at Net Works who might be about to implement a BMC solution.Also, there is additional flexibility in the situation, in that BMC will be 
willing to work with Enron business units with regard to the timing of their 
software purchases as it relates to applicability in EBS' deal.For example , if<span type="person" start="2476240" end="2476252">Randy Matson</span>'s team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their current testing , they could lock in the discount at 45 % by sending an e-mail ( or other form of written communication ) committing to the purchase in 2001 ( the preference would be to get the "buy " done by end of 1st Qtr , if possible ) .This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with 
their purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC.I 'm going to contact your leads (<span type="person" start="2476707" end="2476712">Randy</span>,<span type="person" start="2476714" end="2476719">Bruce</span>, et .al.) to let them know of 
the additional possible discount and the relative ease of securing it...and 
to also help make sure that what BMC is pricing out to all is the correct 
application solution in each instance.Thank you for your help and cooperation ,<span type="person" start="2476985" end="2477010">Jeff YoungfleshMessage-ID</span>: &lt;32169724.1075857608985.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 20 Mar 2001 12:36:00 -0800 (PST)

important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.what's switching vis a vis last year.whats 
production relative to last year.it simplifies the fundamental analysis.From :<span type="person" start="2478202" end="2478234">Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate</span>on 03/12/2001 05 :46 PM To :<span type="person" start="2478262" end="2478285">John Arnold/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>cc : Subject : FW : LNG Weekly Update An initial effort--please comment Message-ID : &lt;13994218.1075857609009.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Tue, 20 Mar 2001 12:22:00 -0800 (PST)

online in the US; two more start in the next two months.We are pretty close 
to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting 
limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.In this framework ,<span type="person" start="2479147" end="2479152">Enron</span>would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system .However, we would hold the book, getting to see what 
everyone was doing at all times.The idea is that if we can move the 
industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information 
advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first 
priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a 
counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that 
will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our 
competitors.Still working on technical issues.The decision to open EOL 
markets would be done on a product by product basis.Give me a call if you 
want to discuss.<span type="person" start="2479908" end="2479922">Andrew Fairley</span>03/13/2001 11:14 AM To :<span type="person" start="2479947" end="2479970">John Arnold/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>cc : Subject : Re : Trip to Houston John Redmond &amp; I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with regard to EOL for UK gas .We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a 
considerably greater share of the market.(We estimate 50% now).Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do.There are 
still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying 
brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!As far as we are 
concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing the 
strategy you mentioned below.Once again , thanks for your help All the best ,<span type="person" start="2480636" end="2480657">Andy John Arnold</span>21/02/2001 04 :26 To :<span type="person" start="2480679" end="2480705">Andrew Fairley/LON/EC T@ECT</span>cc : Subject : Re : Trip to Houston<span type="person" start="2480745" end="2480749">Andy</span>: Enjoyed meeting with you .One more thing I did not address.My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.<span type="person" start="2481844" end="2481866">John Andrew Fairley</span>02/20/2001 11:15 AM To :<span type="person" start="2481891" end="2481918">Phillip K Allen/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>,<span type="person" start="2481920" end="2481943">John Arnold/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>,<span type="person" start="2481945" end="2481968">Scott Neal/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>,<span type="person" start="2481970" end="2481997">Thomas A Martin/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>,<span type="person" start="2481999" end="2482028">Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON</span>,<span type="person" start="2482031" end="2482054">Keith Holst/HOU/EC T@ect</span>cc :<span type="person" start="2482059" end="2482095">David Gallagher/LON/EC T@ECT Subject</span>: Trip to Houston Thank you so much for your time last week .<span type="person" start="2482159" end="2482164">David</span>and I found the time especially valuable .We have spotted several

where agressive inj now are bearish later.so curve should flatten.also 
back of curve (cal2,3) under a lot of pressure now.customers will be buying 
all the way down and will get fucked just like last year.contango has been 
under considerable pressure even with the front falling...any rally should 
result in those snapping in to 4.  good scalp in my opinion.definitely seeing your side on the $5 level.surprised we havent gotten more 
demand back as we sit at these lower levels.off to cabo today for a long weekend.kind of exhausted at work right now so 
a much needed break.slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/15/2001 07:50:59 AM

level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.But<span type="person" start="2517366" end="2517371">Gerry</span>'s short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship , rather a by-product .To facilitate this process of elevating the relationship ,<span type="person" start="2517523" end="2517539">Jennifer Medcalf</span>and I are following up with<span type="person" start="2517568" end="2517580">Bill Lovejoy</span>and<span type="person" start="2517586" end="2517595">Greg Pyle</span>.Lovejoy 's boss is<span type="person" start="2517616" end="2517626">Dan Sytsma</span>, VP of HP 's America 's Central Region .In the conference call Thursday , 12/14 with<span type="person" start="2517713" end="2517725">Peter Goebel</span>and HP regarding wireless initiatives ,<span type="person" start="2517766" end="2517771">Peter</span>will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS initiative by reiterating the following two points : a ) Enron is already an HP customer ; the onus is on HP to move forward on the process of building a strategic relationship ( IBM and Lexmark are only some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running ) b ) HP 's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP 's business relationship process with Enron<span type="person" start="2518214" end="2518228">Patrick Tucker</span>and<span type="person" start="2518233" end="2518243">Dale Clark</span>could build their relationship with<span type="person" start="2518280" end="2518291">Bill Dwyer</span>, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions , ( met at the meeting 11/16 ) in the near term .Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer

     London, March 8 -- Enron announced today that it has concluded a
long-term power trading agreement with the Manx Electricity Authority
(MEA), representing one of the first deals with an embedded generator
specifically designed for the New Electricity Trading Arrangements
(NETA).Under the agreement Enron will provide 24-hour trading services
to MEA under NETA in an innovative deal structured to maximise the value
of the electricity interconnector between the Isle of Man and UK
mainland.The =01A45 million interconnector runs between Bispham in Lancashire
and Douglas on the Isle of Man and is capable of carrying 40MW in each
direction.At 105km it is the longest AC interconnector cable in the
world." The development costs of the interconnector to the UK placed us under pressure to put the link to the highest and best economic use and we feel our relationship with Enron has accomplished this " said<span type="person" start="2539765" end="2539779">Mike Proffitt</span>, Chief Executive of MEA."Our commitment to reducing the price of electricity on the Isle of
Man is firmly embedded in MEA's five year plan and our trading
partnership with Enron will greatly assist us in achieving this goal."<span type="person" start="2540021" end="2540034">Richard Lewis</span>, Managing Director of UK gas and power at Enron , commented : " This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well into Enron 's trading portfolio .MEA will benefit from Enron's expertise
as one of the UK's leading energy traders and will provide us with their
skills as operators of their generation plant and the interconnector.It
is significant in that we believe it is one of the first embedded
generation transactions specially tailored for the new trading
arrangements."Media Contacts :<span type="person" start="2540546" end="2540558">Alex Parsons</span>Enron Tel : 020 7783 2394 Alison Cottier Manx Electricity Tel : 01624 687798 ( db)LO -END- -0- ( CRL ) Mar/08/2001 13 :43 GMT Energy Trading Companies Pay Big for Weather Talent , WSJ Says 2001-03-08 06 :47 ( New York ) Kansas City , March 8 ( Bloomberg ) -- The growth of energy trading floors in the past several years has made meteorology a glamour profession , even for forecasters who never even intended to predict the weather on television , the Wall Street Journal reported .Weather affects commodities trading and determines

National Weather Service pays a junior staffer.Energy traders use in-house weather forecasts to make quick
bets on the direction of electricity and natural gas prices.Fast
and accurate predictions can earn huge profits, the paper said.Many meteorologists say they like the pace and action of the
trading floor.While some in the profession work in broadcasting,
most meteorologists labor in the less visible and action-oriented

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.Our contracts Director ,<span type="person" start="2556221" end="2556230">Tom Moore</span>, and I spoke w/Eric<span type="person" start="2556251" end="2556257">Merten</span>( PDX ) early this afternoon , and he now has the contract .EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).<span type="person" start="2556455" end="2556459">Eric</span>is in the driver 's seat with the contract at this point .I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc.In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.I have followed up the note w/telephone calls &amp; messages to all of them :<span type="person" start="2557018" end="2557030">Doug Cummins</span>,<span type="person" start="2557032" end="2557044">Randy Matson</span>,<span type="person" start="2557046" end="2557058">Bob Martinez</span>,<span type="person" start="2557060" end="2557067">Jim Ogg</span>, and<span type="person" start="2557073" end="2557084">Bruce Smith</span>.I am meeting with<span type="person" start="2557106" end="2557118">Bob Martinez</span>on Wednesday at 3pm .Matson ,<span type="person" start="2557149" end="2557152">Ogg</span>, and<span type="person" start="2557158" end="2557163">Smith</span>have me in their voicemailbox ,<span type="person" start="2557196" end="2557203">Cummins</span>was in a meeting and he said he would call me back .Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?Have I properly conveyed the 
"accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?Your 
note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?I will call you to follow up on this note.Thank you ,<span type="person" start="2557764" end="2557789">Jeff YoungfleshMessage-ID</span>: &lt;33032734.1075857609982.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 7 Mar 2001 01:42:00 -0800 (PST)

destruction.?I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3.cheaper BTUs in ASIA- 
Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore).But I think that we are 
underestimating the structural changes in energy demand.Just as the economy 
is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is 
changing.Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power 
demand as a result of  Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on 
what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying 
is  that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries 
will increase.Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure 
in service industries.?Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have 
imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly 
entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories.Also they will  budget for these prices instead of $2.50
?See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos --- 
increases of 20%.When asked the implication for missed earnings and their 
plans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the 
bright lights business'
?I don't believe the economic doom and gloom
 First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much 
worse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates 
this week.The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar 
which will blow exports.With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will 
not tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction 
in big ticket items purchasing).Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this 
is not everything.Productivity gains are strong.The economy is becoming 
more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the 
whole story.?Finally, I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here.well there's my 2 cents.Jen<span type="person" start="2560595" end="2560635">Fraser Enron Global Markets Fundamentals</span>713-853-4759 -----Original Message----- From :<span type="person" start="2560685" end="2560691">Arnold</span>,<span type="person" start="2560693" end="2560704">John Sent</span>: Wednesday , March 07 , 2001 2:31 PM To :<span type="person" start="2560744" end="2560750">Fraser</span>,<span type="person" start="2560752" end="2560768">Jennifer Subject</span>: RE : i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 2.8.whther that price level is 425 or 725 is arguable.i think it's close to

&gt; Key Points:
&gt; 1. Natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit March at
&gt; roughly 700-800 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the
&gt; end of the traditional withdrawal season.&gt; 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0%this
&gt; year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or
&gt; production added per rig.&gt; 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other
&gt; variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and
&gt; industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning
&gt; of winter will be near or below last year's 2,800 Bcf level.&gt; 4. Thus, it appears likely that the "heat" will remain on natural gas
&gt; prices throughout 2001.&gt; 5 .<span type="person" start="2567657" end="2567669">Consequently</span>, we believe that many E&amp;P shares will post solid gains &gt; again this year , spurred largely by mounting confidence in the &gt; sustainability of strong natural gas prices .&gt;

    WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. electricity demand
will grow by about 2.3 percent in 2001, down from 3.6 percent
growth last year due to the nation's slowing economy, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday.Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent this
year, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report.Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S.
electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal.U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was
forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIA
said.That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwh
forecast by the agency last month.For the entire winter heating season of October through
March, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent
from the previous year, the EIA said.The increase was driven
by the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecst
to be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively.More electricity plants were expected to switch from
natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, the
government report said."This trend is expected to continue through the first
quarter 2001," the EIA said."Although the favorable price
differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue
through the forecast period, by the second half of 2001,
expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keep
gas demand for power generation growing."The monthly report also said that mild weather has eased
natural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gas
supply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricity
plants.California has been fighting all winter to maintain

''<span type="person" start="2582458" end="2582473">Spencer Abraham</span>, the new energy secretary , said Californians simply goofed , setting up a ' 'dysfunctional '' system .It is the way California deregulated, not 
deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate 
about whether -- not just how -- to deregulate.Among them is<span type="person" start="2582818" end="2582824">Alfred</span>E. Kahn , the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free markets in the rail , trucking and airline industries .''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,'' Mr. Kahn said.He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain 
the whole problem.But he is sounding a note of skepticism.''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,'' he 
said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power 
company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity.''It may be one 
industry in which it works reasonably well.''Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical.When this former<span type="person" start="2583525" end="2583531">Carter</span>administration official was pushing deregulation , it was still a novel and politically risky concept .Today, getting government out of most businesses 
is part of the Washington economic canon.Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its 
electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory.To 
satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which 
soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went 
on the auction block.Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power 
on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might 
have allowed them to hedge risk.Consumer prices were also fixed, making it 
impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs.<span type="person" start="2584353" end="2584367">Paul L. Joskow</span>, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn 's , remains hopeful that the kinks can be ironed out .In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, 
Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, 
regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws.They have found 
ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and 
charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said.Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price 
signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so 
that they have reserves for peak hours.During peak hours, shortages and 
price spikes can substantially raise average prices.''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do 
it here,'' Mr. Joskow said.Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices.Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one.Making sure 
Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another.''The political system must rise to the task,'' Mr. Joskow said, or the ''old 
way might be the best we can do.''Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way.In the mid-1970's, he headed the New 
York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated 
industries.The drawbacks were legendary.Local utilities had an endemic 
tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which 
consumers paid through steady rate increases.Nearly everyone assumed that 
competition would slash prices.But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline 
prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities 
of electricity, Mr. Kahn said.Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep 
prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin.The vertical 
integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn 
said.Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal 
ways.Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them 
to be built.''The players all depended on one another,'' he said.California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts.But it has made 
people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for 
widgets.Photo :<span type="person" start="2586804" end="2586810">Alfred</span>E. Kahn Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company , Inc.All Rights Reserved.National Desk

It 's very unfair , "<span type="person" start="2590141" end="2590144">Lay</span>said , his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality ."He's trying to vilify us.But we didn't make the rules in California.We had

maligned."In a sense, he's right.The ultimate blame does rest with California 
policymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such a 
ham-fisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting 
loopholes in the system.But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process." Enron and<span type="person" start="2590858" end="2590865">Ken Lay</span>were one of the major players behind the push for deregulation in California , " said<span type="person" start="2590951" end="2590970">Janee Briesemeister</span>, senior policy analyst in the Austin office of Consumers Union ."A lot of what's happening in 
California was their idea."Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said Enron was 
especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where 
wholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent 
System Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid." This fragmented the wholesale market , making it harder to monitor , " said<span type="person" start="2591448" end="2591458">John Rozsa</span>, an aide to state Sen.<span type="person" start="2591482" end="2591493">Steve Peace</span>,<span type="person" start="2591495" end="2591505">D-El Cajon</span>, widely regarded as the godfather of California 's bungled deregulation measures ." Enron is n't in the business of making markets work , "<span type="person" start="2591643" end="2591648">Rozsa</span>said ."They're in 
the business of making a buck."In an ironic twist, however, Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping 
the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing.The company has 
that much clout.SEEKING LAY'S BLESSING 
Thus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission 
lines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to call 
recently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan.This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had been castigated by<span type="person" start="2592199" end="2592204">Davis</span>in the governor 's State of the State speech ."I told him we couldn't support it," Lay said, a hint of a smile playing 
across his lips."It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid 
and, longer term, it could make things worse."Why would<span type="person" start="2592459" end="2592464">Davis</span>swallow his pride and court favor with Enron 's big cheese ?Simple :<span type="person" start="2592533" end="2592538">Davis</span>will need the<span type="person" start="2592553" end="2592557">Bush</span>administration 's backing to make the power-line sale fly , and , many believe , there 's no faster way to reach the new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron .Lay , 58 , and his company have donated more than $ 500,000 to<span type="person" start="2592808" end="2592812">Bush</span>'s various political campaigns in recent years , and he placed Enron 's private jet at<span type="person" start="2592899" end="2592903">Bush</span>'s disposal during the presidential race .So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is now 
serving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as 
he sees fit." There 's a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political relationships to get what it wants , " said<span type="person" start="2593226" end="2593240">Craig McDonald</span>, director of Texans for Public Justice , a watchdog group ." What<span type="person" start="2593306" end="2593313">Ken Lay</span>thinks energy policy should be is n't very different from what<span type="person" start="2593377" end="2593388">George Bush</span>and<span type="person" start="2593393" end="2593404">Dick Cheney</span>think it should be . "ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
Lay, of course, sees things differently.At the mere mention of his close 
rapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited 
the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months."I have known the president and his family for many years," Lay said."I've 
been a strong supporter of his.I believe in him and I believe in his 
policies."He insisted that reports of his having sway over<span type="person" start="2593869" end="2593873">Bush</span>on energy matters are "grossly exaggerated . "Still , it is striking that<span type="person" start="2593948" end="2593952">Bush</span>'s quick decision after taking office to limit federal assistance in solving California 's energy woes virtually mirrored Lay 's own thoughts on the situation .So, too, with the administration's 
hands-off approach to resolving the crisis.Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to Enron's bottom 
line.The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year.They haven't hurt Lay, either.According to company records, his pay package 
more than tripled last year to $18.3 million.Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company's 
California earnings from other worldwide business activities.But Lay 
conceded that Enron's profit from California energy deals last year was "not 
inconsequential.""We benefit from the volatility," he said.CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE 
That's putting it mildly.It could be said that California's energy mess was 
tailor-made for Enron, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a 
captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are 
simultaneously soaring skyward.To understand why that is, one must look closely at Enron's complex business 
model.The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy 
deals.Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy 
regulator, set about completely reinventing Enron in 1985 after taking over 
what was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator.As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of 
energy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas 
is needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time.Enron is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage 
to consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers 
and sellers throughout the country.It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually 
creative deals.For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas 
prices up, Enron might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in return 
for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants.Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the 
proceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it 
ships back to the original utility."We do best in competitive markets," Lay said."These are sustainable 
markets."TRADING FRENZY 
Enron's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly 
young, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of 
the best deals.Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost 
frat-party atmosphere.The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an 
Internet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336 
billion, making Enron by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity.<span type="person" start="2596898" end="2596910">Kevin Presto</span>, who oversees Enron 's East Coast power trades , called up the California electricity market on his computer .With a few quick mouse clicks, 
he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at 
$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275." Some days we 're at $ 250 , some days $ 300 and some days $ 500 , "<span type="person" start="2597239" end="2597245">Presto</span>said over the steady thump-thump of the trading floor 's rock 'n' roll soundtrack ."There's truly a problem out there."This is a recurring theme among Enron officials: California's electricity 
market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down.As 
Lay himself put it, "The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace."In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isn't just 
making piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going.LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA 
The company's energy services division, which handles the complete energy 
needs of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of 
California and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., and 
even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park.Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market 
values.At the same time, Enron sells power to PG&amp;E at sky-high wholesale 
levels.In other words, Enron is buying back its own electricity from PG&amp;E for just a 
fraction of the price it charges the utility." These guys are the pariahs of the power system , " said<span type="person" start="2598462" end="2598473">Nettie Hoge</span>, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco ."Why do we need 
middlemen?They don't do anything except mark up the cost."To be fair, energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient 
marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers.This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where Enron actively trades among 
about 200 market participants.But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like Enron can 
easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceived 
regulatory framework.Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state 
committee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame Enron and other 
power companies for pursuing profits in California."California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules 
California set up," he said."At the end of the day, they will behave to 
enhance their bottom lines."But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next year ,<span type="person" start="2599533" end="2599539">Turner</span>said he has learned from California 's experience -- and is taking steps to prevent Texas ' power giants from shaking down local consumers .LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE 
He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission 
more authority in cracking down on market abuses.The power companies are 
fighting the legislation as hard as they can.Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what California 
officials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power 
by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher."I have that concern," he said."I don't necessarily take these companies at 
their word."For his part, Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated 
electricity prices."I don't know of any of that," he said."It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories."As a sign of Enron's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Lay 
said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power 
contracts on behalf of utilities.So how many contracts has Enron signed?Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and a 
harder, more steely look glinted from his eyes."None," he said."We won't be signing until we're certain about recovering 
our costs."Consider this a shot across California's bow.PHOTO ; Caption : Chairman<span type="person" start="2600915" end="2600926">Kenneth Lay</span>said Enron had "nothing to do with creating the ( energy ) problem .

crisis.And he thinks it unfair that<span type="person" start="2602523" end="2602528">Davis</span>has blamed out-of-state energy brokers for the protracted problems ."We didn't make the rules in California," Lay said."We had nothing to do 
with creating the problem."The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of the 
power industry in 1996.Enron encouraged deregulation, and the state's 
ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation.Enron's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to 
$101 billion.Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16 
million in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared 
with less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999.Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off California's crisis, though he 
conceded the profit was "not inconsequential.""We benefit from the volatility," said Lay, who took over Enron in 1985 and 
has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of 
electricity as a commodity.But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by 
insisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep 
the lights on in recent months."I don't know of any of that," he said."It's so easy to conjure up

The Stadium Curse?/ Some stocks swoon after arena deals<span type="person" start="2603918" end="2603933">Kathleen Pender</span>03/04/2001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL B1 ( Copyright 2001 ) Is buying the name of a big-league stadium the kiss of death for a company , or does it only seem that way ?From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field 
outside Boston, the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies 
whose stocks have been sacked.The Super Bowl champion<span type="person" start="2604318" end="2604334">Baltimore Ravens</span>play in a stadium named after PSINet , whose stock has fallen 92 percent to $ 1.25 a share since it bought naming rights .The problem names are not all tech.The owners of the TWA Dome in St. Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are 
looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt.TWA is an airline.Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom.The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if 
Edison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison, 
runs out of juice.Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens 
or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a 
ballpark or arena.In fact, many were at their peak.Which begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which 
they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights?<span type="person" start="2605238" end="2605249">Brian Pears</span>, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management , wonders if companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the " Sports Illustrated curse . "It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI 
magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle.Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.comChief Executive Officer<span type="person" start="2605620" end="2605630">Jeff Bezos</span>was named Time magazine 's 1999 person of the year just before his company 's stock price tanked .<span type="person" start="2605729" end="2605740">Don Hinchey</span>, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals , does n't think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals ."You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming 
rights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peak 
in its business," says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham 
Group in Denver.TRACKING NAMING FIRMS 
To find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of 
publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league 
sports venues in North America.I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies , including<span type="person" start="2606398" end="2606409">Miller Park</span>in Milwaukee (<span type="person" start="2606424" end="2606430">Miller</span><span type="person" start="2606431" end="2606438">Brewing</span>is part of Philip Morris ) and Pac Bell Park in San Francisco ( Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications , which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio ) .I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals 
are, after all, marketing endeavors.The announcement of a deal generates 
tons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is 
negative and even if the stadium won't open for several years.Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 index during the same period.The bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names 
are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced, 
according to data from FactSet Research Systems.(Two companies each bought 
two names and were counted twice.)But -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&amp;P 500 during the 
period since their respective deals were announced.So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee the 
company will beat the market.WINNERS, LOSERS 
The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide 
variety of industries.The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company.Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746 
percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium.The next-biggest winners include Target ( discount stores ) , Ericsson (telecom equipment ) ,<span type="person" start="2607936" end="2607941">Coors</span>( beer ) , Fleet Financial ( banking ) , Pepsi ( soft drinks ) and Enron ( energy ) .The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI 
(Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network 
Associates (network security software).Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming 
rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998.Since then, it has suffered 
a string of setbacks.After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned 
its accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and 
1998.Its CEO resigned in December.Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the 
coliseum name.It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years.The company "has been paying us , " says<span type="person" start="2608736" end="2608749">Deena McClain</span>, general counsel with the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority ."We haven't had any 
discussions with them" about changing the contract.Most naming-rights contracts have "out clauses that allow the parties to 
extricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial 
difficulties or if a team moves," says Hinchey.Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may 
benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early.That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s, 
when $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average.In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of 
the Washington Redskins.In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name on 
the new home of the New England Patriots.It's questionable what kind of 
shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year.The "10-gallon hat of naming rights deals," says Hinchey, is in Houston, 
where Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name the 
Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself.Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal 
was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates.Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a 
stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends.But<span type="person" start="2610139" end="2610152">Jim Grinstead</span>, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues , says , "you have to look at the ( stadium ) purchase in light of total marketing budget .It sounds 
like big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years.If you take out 
things the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it's 
small potatoes."WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH 
The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game 
is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print." This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding , " says<span type="person" start="2610679" end="2610696">Jennifer Keavney</span>, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal .She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, "won't even buy you a 
Super Bowl ad.It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised 
football game, maybe."The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboard 
for the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports.Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site 
exposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might 
offer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers.Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name 
because they sell consumer products or services.But not always.3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995." It was a good move for them , " says<span type="person" start="2611618" end="2611631">Jim Grinstead</span>, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues ."They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility 
they were looking for.At the time, they were a player in a crowded field, 
and they wanted to look like a fun place to work."Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years.The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility 
will be a loser."Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and 
hospitality efforts.Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not 
performing well," Hinchey says."But corporations realize the team's success 
on the field fluctuates.It could be a champion one year, next year in the 
dumps."The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium 
owners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when they 
sell a name.PHOTO ; Caption :<span type="person" start="2612535" end="2612546">Rich Gannon</span>of the Oakland Raiders scored in Oakland 's Network Associates Coliseum last year ./ Frederic Larson/The Chronicle 2000

Weather a little cooler for this 
week.Overall normal for 6-10.JV up 12 cents.Think just as customers got 
totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all 
the way down.Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the 
length.This year trade not ready to get really short.Not until healthy 
inj in April anyways.I think money from here will be made being short, 
just question of what and when.Think there'll be enough hedging demand to 
keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going 
to dictate prices for next couple months.I think it will be spec and 
hedgers dictating.Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.Leads to more upside potential in short term.My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell 
side leading to pressure on those spreads.The california term power sales 
have totally changed that.Before, the only thing customers were selling was 
cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from 
california.Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.You have very valid points.i like q/v more though.I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that 
with little downside.Thoughts?Message-ID: &lt;33334721.1075857610395.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Sat, 3 Mar 2001 12:10:00 -0800 (PST)

bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of 
recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a 
little far fetched to me.Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have 
had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.that includes commercial residential 
industrial switching processing...    
as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was 
extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be 
running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 
5% still and hydro way down.every molecule that can will flow west from 
waha this summer versus little last year.east power prices really havent 
reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where 
gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.some concern of 
more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.we're trying to build 
the stack now to estimate.frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.will 
continue coming back.a little concerned about 2 oil prices.bordering 
right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 
100,000 last week as gas got to parity.let me look into inj capability.definitely bigger when field is empty from 
engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen 
demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.really 
inactive.to clarify, not raging bull.i like everybody want to see what the inj 
numbers in april look like.nobody putting a position on until that starts 
to clarify.just think that hedging demand is making market a little short 
right now making next move up more likely.would be scale up seller though
not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.doesnt make any sense.however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to 
great in my opinion to keep spread there.must close one way or the other.notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?
in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.50 
cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.market needs to see some big stg numbers first.i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last 
year's early weather, bombs away.slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/03/2001 07:03:14 AM

Subject: friday



this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires
power px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient,
weather of course.but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in
july-shud be marginal in apr-jun
   if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is
implied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys 
like
me turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be
less factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&amp;d swing will
be closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think
we'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner
     now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx 
where
we are today
    all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider
extraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured
before-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie
liquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel.some
ammonia/fert prod  has come back as well.but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d
industrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha
unction of an economic slowdown.anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your 
big
fund customers(ospraie).we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seems 
quieter
in the mkt lately.heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is
on a weekly basis?we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then
means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and
be unable to inject all the gas available?thots
    also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct
discount lately daily vs next month futs?why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it

151.Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week.94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 
3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81
4th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 
1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ??

Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?It 
wasn't even really cold.That would have been the highest AGA # of the three 
weeks by 15 bcf.Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 
3.5-4 bcf/d.That's just destruction and does not include new production, if 
any.Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of 
Feb.Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d 
more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.Start with a 400 b 
deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in 
current price environment.I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but 
with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the 
market right now are to the upside in my view.Course hard to imagine $6 for 
J.   Just sell vol.slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/02/2001 10:54:14 AM

off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day
swing y
on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their
feet and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes
as
current.very little if any dist fuel switching.i think the answer is
no-not
unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q.remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started
only 6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full
swing.we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal( ie term px for the summer ) , starting april we 'll have a surplus the other way by july barring a greenhouse in the ohio valley good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong ! ! ! ha John.Arnold@enron.com on 02/27/2001 08:23 :22 PM To :<span type="person" start="2641674" end="2641708">Steve LaFontaine/GlobalCo@GlobalCo</span>cc : Fax to : Subject : Re : mkts Good to hear from you .After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.It was.Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.just a big chop fest.i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply.Call it 2 with LNG.Imports from Canada should be
negligible.Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.Don't think $4 does that.What level did we start
really losing demand last year?It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.Think gas is fairly valued here.Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.slafontaine@globalp.com on 02/26/2001 04:48:06 PM

its been a while-hope all is well.not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around.5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing .then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer.there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat.i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/dloss.put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices.takes us to
3.6
tcf or so.what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.as far as that other thing, the p&amp;c its still alive, shud know more soon

off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day swing 
y
on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their feet 
and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes as
current.very little if any dist fuel switching.i think the answer is no-not
unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q.remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started only 
6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full swing.we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal( ie term px for the summer ) , starting april we 'll have a surplus the other way by july barring a greenhouse in the ohio valley good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong ! ! ! ha John.Arnold@enron.com on 02/27/2001 08:23 :22 PM To :<span type="person" start="2650844" end="2650878">Steve LaFontaine/GlobalCo@GlobalCo</span>cc : Fax to : Subject : Re : mkts Good to hear from you .After a great F, had an okay G.

its been a while-hope all is well.not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around.5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing .then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer.there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat.i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/dloss.put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices.takes us to
3.6
tcf or so.what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.as far as that other thing, the p&amp;c its still alive, shud know more soon

investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as
private equity and hedge funds.Our group has also found that high net
worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you
structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.We then
provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional
money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.We also provide
the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations
to the appropriate indices.I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your
previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor
was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.If your schedule permits, I
would like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in more

&gt; Key Points:
&gt; 1. Natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit March at
&gt; roughly 700-800 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the
&gt; end of the traditional withdrawal season.&gt; 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0%this
&gt; year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or
&gt; production added per rig.&gt; 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other
&gt; variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and
&gt; industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning
&gt; of winter will be near or below last year's 2,800 Bcf level.&gt; 4. Thus, it appears likely that the "heat" will remain on natural gas
&gt; prices throughout 2001.&gt; 5 .<span type="person" start="2680916" end="2680928">Consequently</span>, we believe that many E&amp;P shares will post solid gains &gt; again this year , spurred largely by mounting confidence in the &gt; sustainability of strong natural gas prices .&gt;

EOL.However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.<span type="person" start="2693382" end="2693405">John Andrew Fairley</span>02/20/2001 11:15 AM To :<span type="person" start="2693430" end="2693457">Phillip K Allen/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>,<span type="person" start="2693459" end="2693482">John Arnold/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>,<span type="person" start="2693484" end="2693507">Scott Neal/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>,<span type="person" start="2693509" end="2693536">Thomas A Martin/HOU/EC T@ECT</span>,<span type="person" start="2693538" end="2693567">Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON</span>,<span type="person" start="2693570" end="2693593">Keith Holst/HOU/EC T@ect</span>cc :<span type="person" start="2693598" end="2693634">David Gallagher/LON/EC T@ECT Subject</span>: Trip to Houston Thank you so much for your time last week .<span type="person" start="2693698" end="2693703">David</span>and I found the time especially valuable .We have spotted several

(purchase commitment) is did I convey the info correctly re:  what BMC will 
accept from Enron to allow the EBS deal to close?From notes to the Net Works directors and<span type="person" start="2726557" end="2726570">Bob McAuliffe</span>, I have copied the following statements into the space below : " 1 ) The pricing is applicable if EBS gets their deal done , and you are willing to provide some form of commitment ( at least in writing , either e-mail or letterhead ) to purchasing a BMC product in 2001 ...For example , if<span type="person" start="2726862" end="2726874">Randy Matson</span>'s team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their current testing , they could lock in the discount at 45 % by sending an e-mail ( or other form of written communication ) committing to the purchase in 2001 ( the preference would be to get the "buy " done by end of 1st Qtr , if possible ) .This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with their 
purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC."Is this correct the 
way I have presented it to NetWorks?Will their replies work for you if 
completed as requested above?I didn't want to put you in a bind when I told the NetWorks teams what BMC 
would feel is acceptable proof-of-commitment, nor did I want to have to go 
back to the Net Works group and change the requirements.I 've got another note to send you in a minute or so , from<span type="person" start="2727692" end="2727704">Doug Cummins</span>.Thank you ,<span type="person" start="2727718" end="2727762">Jeff Chaz Vaughan@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS</span>12/12/2000 07 :29 PM To :<span type="person" start="2727794" end="2727824">Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON</span>cc :<span type="person" start="2727832" end="2727887">Stephen Morse/Enron Communications@Enron Communications</span>Subject : Re : BMC Update<span type="person" start="2727916" end="2727920">Jeff</span>, Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal .We are making real progress.Here are the answers to your questions:

1.How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?$4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services
2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 
3.  Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving 
purchase commitment from Enron?Not sure what you mean here
4.  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be 
done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?We prefer the 14th, but if we can't get it until the 15th, that will work


Please let me know if you have any other questions.I will call you tomorrow 
to touch base.Thanks,

Lakes area by the last half of the period.This shift allows for cold
Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by
days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).The Canadian and
European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the
Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued
ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping
them warmer and away from the cold.The American eliminates this
southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian
breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold
weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.The European appears
to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South.In all cases,
the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada
with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be
available with the 6:30am ET release.-Matt<span type="person" start="2742167" end="2742189">Rogers Message-ID</span>: &lt;18792578.1075849626321.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 13 Dec 2000 02:43:00 -0800 (PST)

morning to go to Vail.Apparently I missed a little craziness.My point
on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily
trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes
equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.Look at k/m... do you think k
cash will average 3 cents above m.i don't really see that scenario.yet
that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get
there k/m=3.The same argument applies to v/x.i think this summer will
be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last
year.But cal 2 will lag the move.It's the main thing customers are
selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling
their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.so either the v/x and x/z
spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.After this winter, who in there
right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.my thought is that the primary
juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.i'm a
seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.Not much in it either way though.slafontaine@globalp.com on 01/31/2001 04:47:22 PM

morning to go to Vail.Apparently I missed a little craziness.My point on 
v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on 
value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between 
hedging and spec demand.Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 
cents above m.i don't really see that scenario.yet that's what it is 
worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3.The 
same argument applies to v/x.i think this summer will be exceptionally 
strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year.But cal 2 will 
lag the move.It's the main thing customers are selling right now because 
every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 
will average 3.50.so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j 
blow out.After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h 
again.my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will 
be under some pressure.i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.Not much in it 
either way though.slafontaine@globalp.com on 01/31/2001 04:47:22 PM

you got me wrong-i wanna sell oct buy nov forward.look-two scenarios med 
longer
term.we inject like mad early summer-economy stays crappy the frot of the 
curve
gets slaughtered.-oct/novgoes to 3 cts sometime between now and end sep
   scenario 2-they dont enject what they want-oct /nov wil stay tite between 
say
3-and 10 cts like this year but man after this winter they will panic at some
point and buy the hell out of the winter strip and blow out oct /nov to 30 cts
cuz they panic.to me if that one was to ever backwardate it was this 
summer-low
low stx and injections and they still blew out cuz they panicked about 
winter-as

deal.customer, maybe a hedge fund, bot 1000+ jv 450 puts.weather 
frustrating me too.a little long but it's in the backs so I haven't been 
hurt.Sure would be nice to get some more weather and have this thing start 
going crazy again.Seen liquids processing come back on at these levels.Would guess more than 50% has from peak.Industrial demand different story.industrial economy just so weak that many petchems and others are burning 
less because of their markets, not fuel costs.Chrystler is a prime 
example.Any switching back to gas from industrial or switching back to 
domestic production from overseas muted by weak economy.slafontaine@globalp.com on 01/31/2001 10:46:50 AM

A HUGE THANK YOU from me to you!This is exactly what I was hoping for (even 
if the amount of purchase is not what some folks might have been wishing for, 
the reply is critically important)!I really appreciate your having taken 
the time to help out by providing this information.I will check back with you on Thursday, if I haven't heard from you by then, 
to see about the "commitment letter"!Thank you again ,<span type="person" start="2792577" end="2792585">Jeff p.s</span>.I will be forwarding your note to<span type="person" start="2792622" end="2792634">Randy Matson</span>and<span type="person" start="2792639" end="2792651">Bob Martinez</span>, to see if it would help them in their efforts .I'll also copy you on that one.Douglas Cummins@ECT 12/12/2000 06 :37 PM To :<span type="person" start="2792789" end="2792819">Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON</span>cc : Chaz Vaughan/Enron Communications@Enron Communications ,<span type="person" start="2792883" end="2792939">Stephen Morse/Enron Communications@Enron Communications</span>Subject : Re : Urgent - Please Read - BMC question<span type="person" start="2792993" end="2792997">Jeff</span>,<span type="person" start="2793000" end="2793008">Honestly</span>and for your ( Enron ) eyes only - attached is the modified spreadsheet of what my group is seriously looking at purchasing .Basically,

this weekend will probably trade $.15 over.the lack of weather giving the 
market time to regroup.good thing because another week of cold and the 
system was going to break.certainly still has that chance in feb.saw 
utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting 
any extra demand through spot market.in effect, they said we're not 
withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage.they had to encourage 
marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even 
normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again.this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in 
mkt.g/h getting whacked in sympathy.probably priced 25 term deals through broker market  and own originators in 
past two days.24 were from the buy side.it's as if pira came in and told 
everyone term was cheap.however, they've got the opposite view.customers 
just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now.don't see any let up in 
back support for a while.front spreads the hardest call right now.g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what 
to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody 
else.almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping 
for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in 
cash.probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less 
downside.doing well here.actually having the best month ever 11 days in.played 
front short against term length.got out of front shorts today.probably 
early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected.will keep term length meanwhile.i've hated summer backwardation forever.agree about u/h.  a little less crazy about  the trade now because i think 
the easy money was made over the past two days.unbelievable spec demand for 
next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and 
crushed on move down.jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front 
virtually unchanged.don't know what to think of this summer longer term.certainly not as easy 
as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas.now $6 for this summer, i don't know.we're gonna have to inject the hell 
out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.but we will feel 
production increase hit the market.just buy vol.slafontaine@globalp.com on 01/11/2001 04:48:32 PM

I quickly plotted the short and the long curves and the following come out in 
your face.

1.Is this policy easing going to be a one shot ( a la 98 ) followed by a 
quick pick up in economic activity, or is this going to be a more deeper 
situation.That is the big one.The curves vote for a small road-bump which 
will be rectified by a couple of eases over the next 6 months.Something the 
Fed can handle easily and quickly.This is most likely NOT going to happen - 
this is not a 98 and things are going to play out differently.There are a 
number of other possibilities.2. The current slow-down is two pronged - capital spending slowdown from 
businesses ( especially on IT with the internet bust ) and the consumer 
spending slow-down , possibly because of the stock market wealth effect.Both 
of these have already hit the durable goods section.This reversal is 'Real' 
which takes longer to turn then the 'Financial crisis' hence there is good 
possibility we see a protraction of this weakness and even coupled with the 
fed eases this is going to take longer than six months to get better.3. The new administration is going to take this as a good opportunity to 
force tax cuts.How does the Fed look at those ?Will the Fed balk and be 
less aggressive in the rate cuts expecting the tax cuts , will it ignore 
them.That makes the equation harder.It also to some extent argues that 
longer term rates go up if these tax cuts materialize.But on the shorter 
term who that effects Fed policy will have profound effect on the curve.All these favor a steeper curve.The 2-5 at -23 ( -6 on swap curve ), 2 -10 
at -15 ( 18 on the swaps ) and 2-30 at 19 bps ( 37 bp) should all be steeper 
as market realizes the length of this ease cycle.If this cycle lasts an 
year ( the final and the last ease happens next Dec ) then the 2-10 should be 
40 bp positive, as the market realizes that.Message-ID: &lt;25073500.1075848343483.JavaMail.evans@thyme&gt;Date: Thu, 21 Dec 2000 10:05:00 -0800 (PST)

Good Day to you.I would like to introduce myself and my company.Kalahari Ltd is a UK based software company that has for the past 14
years been supply pricing software to the Financial Markets.Over the past year we have been branching out into the energy markets
and are currently working for a number of UK based Electricity
companies.One such company (London Electricity) has asked us to produce software
to filter and highlight online trading prices.This allows them to see
ONLY the best price in the market for any one product at a time.This is
due to the sudden explosion of internet based price delivery systems.To
enable us to acieve their requirements we require an API to the relative
online trading systems.Today I spoke to a gentlemen in your call centre
who gave me your contact details.Could you please advise me if you do
indeed publish an API to your internet trading platform and if so how do
I go about getting it.We would of course be prepared to sign a non disclosure agreement in
this respect.I look forward to hearing from you in due course.With kind regards<span type="person" start="2875306" end="2875369">Graham Mansfield Deputy Managing Director Kalahari Limited Tel</span>: +44 ( 0 )1483 756246 Fax :+44 ( 0 )1483 756300 www.kalahari.co.uk &gt; ********************************************************************** &gt; ********* &gt; The information in this Internet e-mail is confidential and may be &gt; legally privileged .It is intended solely for the addressee.Access

Hi Jean-Maurice,

I just wanted to touch base with you to see how your DealBench experience
is going.I realize you may have some colleagues that are working with you
that may not have been in our demo in November.I'm happy to spend some
time with them on the phone walking through the functionality within the
site.Please feel free to call me at 713-345-3726.I look forward to hearing from you to know how things are going.Kind Regards,

Subject: Re: quick question


Just got off the phone with Kira.She asked me what y'all do and I probably
butchered it, but she sounded interested (especially when I closed by saying 
it
would be a business services, fee-based revenue stream - from what I know in
the industry, Yahoo's all about that these days, trying to find complements to
its existing largely ad-driven model for which they are getting pummeled).She
said you should forward any information on to her at kira@yahoo-inc.com.To
reach her by phone (I'd recommend handling initial contact through email and
then suggesting phone time, but your call), I don't have her direct number, 
but
called the main Yahoo corporate number 408-731-3300, then used the dial by 
name
directory - her last name is spelled Zahn, but you have to keep adding letters
from her first name (i went through K-I) before it will recognize it.She and
her husband both were in law school with me and are very, very cool folks.He
works at Silicon Valley Bank now.Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.chad

&gt; Yes, I do.Two actually.<span type="person" start="2888160" end="2888171">Drew Lanham</span>and Kira Zann .Rather than me

week on  already such has been the pace of activity here .The  ebb and flow 
in the Ali  market both in the spreads and outright price have kept  our 
valiant dealers on their toes  as  seemingly the whole market  vies to  avail 
itself of our  pricing and liquidity services on-line ! .Daily volumes 
have  continued to grow with  over 800  separate transactions being seen 
today! .In fact volumes have risen by approximately  56% since December  
from a daily average  of 357 to a daily average of 557  for January .At the 
same time the regular Non-EOL transaction count has decreased from about 1800 
trades a day to 1586 trades  since December.Your efforts at getting  the  
registered customers who had not  completed an on line trade are beginning 
to  pay dividends  finally - but the migration remains painfully slow .Keep 
plugging away 
   
                




                            

 The graph  above illustrates the growth of our  average daily online 
transaction volumes  in relation to our regular transaction volume on a 
monthly basis  from July of 99 to date .This week's daily  transaction volume  is another  record and   but for the 
blip on Monday  which put down to the  Mother's day in Africa  holiday  would 
have been sensational .We have asked for your response to several queries over the past three weeks 
and have received little or no  reaction.<span type="person" start="2894391" end="2894403">Consequently</span>we shall ask again .Currently at the top of the list : if each of you could create a list of Metals Conferences you believe would be beneficial for Enron metals to attend , speak at and/ or have metals or<span type="person" start="2894614" end="2894625">EnronOnline</span>presence , it would be greatly appreciated .This is a multi faceted sales and marketing tool for 
your benefit  .Aside from the overall goal of creating a unified metals 
marketing plan, we are also trying to prepare a budget to assure that proper 
attention and funds are given Enron metals Global exposure in 2001 .Therefore, if we do not receive your recommendations  well in  advance we 
will not be in a position to sponsor them .We have created a conference 
listing which will be circulated next week .Please add to it  if we have 
missed any off .and mark onto our list those you think should have  our 
attention .For those of you that missed it last week, we have attached another copy of 
the Account Application Form.The completion of this form for BOTH 
traditional and online customers will speed your client's access to trading 
with Enron Metals.The lack of contributions for this review  from  any of you is  rather 
disappointing .We will continue to offer you  items that you may find of use 
.However the purpose of this  review is also  to incorporate content  from  
around the network of our  global field offices.I know you are all very 
busy  making money for the cause .This  medium is  a useful platform to get 
your message over .For those of you not on the circulation lists  see the attached reports    

       The Metals Crammer report    


       The daily Options report 




 Whilst not exactly a feature  we thought it might be  a useful exercise in  
client relationship damage  limitation  to explain   what happens when a 
customer finds he cannot trade  on line .This has begun to occur more 
regularly as our volumes and activity increase.Customers are allocated  a credit line for EOL within the system based upon 
their  agreements.This limit   is set daily   as a  default against the 
clients name .basis the AS400 's  net valuation of the client's position  .The amount of available  variation  credit  on the client's account  on EOL 
is  set as his  limit f or the next days trading .If the client should 
trigger this limit  during the next day's trading  the system will reject the 
trade and lock out the customer .Not very user friendly   as the customer is 
not told why .London credit (Hamish's team) get a red flag , as of course 
do the traders running the stack managers as they see the trade rejected.The problem now becomes one of frustration for the customer as the system 
will not allow him to liquidate his position either in part or whole .He will 
have to pick the phone to do this .Secondly the resetting of any limit in 
the system takes 48hrs .This  is being  worked on but  we must remember 
that Metals are the only futures products on the system and the other OTC 
products on the system  are dealt with differently .It also serves to 
highlight that  clients with small credit lines in the 1 to 200,000 dollar 
range are not really suited to use EOL .Security  such as g/tees and cash 
are taken into account but can be missed  ,but forward profits are as it is 
net availability that is  used on the AS400.This will all improve with the 
introduction of  a new bridge  between the Enron  risk system and the AS400  
in the very near future .In the meantime  it will be up to you to  keep the peace and explain to your 
clients .Get them to keep within their limits .Call them quickly when they 
get locked out.Remember, we are here to help your efforts and help create positive 
communication lines between our offices world-wide.So, send us your 
thoughts, questions, concerns, local area market news  etc.We will look 
forward to hearing from you.Cheers ,<span type="person" start="2898338" end="2898342">Alex</span>and<span type="person" start="2898347" end="2898387">Molly Alex Heath Molly Hellerman</span>alex .heath@enron.commolly.hellerman@enron.com+44 207 783 2071    +44 207 783 5198

and left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives
Enron and what the company seeks in its applicants.Your responses to my
questions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company.As you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and
Electronic Commerce.I graduated Summa Cum Laude from<span type="person" start="2902623" end="2902630">Bentley</span>College in May of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics &amp; Finance , and I received an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge in August of 1995 .After graduating from<span type="person" start="2902837" end="2902844">Bentley</span>, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as an analyst in its Financial Development Program .Most recently, I worked as
an investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major
business development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44
million and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of
Thomson's key competitors.I also performed strategic, market, and
competitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's
overall competitiveness.My professional experiences working in the High
Technology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a
complete redefinition of my career goals.I much prefer to be on the front

organizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and
competitive position in the market.I am anxious to begin my career with
Enron and believe that a relationship with company would prove mutually
beneficial.In closing, I would like to thank you again for interviewing me in
Nashville.If you have any questions, please contact via e-mail at

at best, five sealed-bids over the next three months.However, for each of 
the bids there may be more than 10 lots in each bid.Looking at the attached 
Notice of Solicitation as an example, we have 7 separate blocks for suppliers 
to bid having up-to 3 bid scenarios for each block for a total of 21 lots for 
this phase.The way I see it, future soliciations will follow a similar 
model.Having said this, an alternative to the current language would be to have 5-6 
sealed bid opportunities with a 20-25 lot limit for each bid.Does this work 
for you or does this complicate the process for your group?Please advise ....<span type="person" start="2911766" end="2911769">Sam</span>5-6785 To :<span type="person" start="2911786" end="2911807">John Wack/HOU/EES@EES</span>,<span type="person" start="2911809" end="2911834">Brad J Snyder/HOU/EES@EES</span>,<span type="person" start="2911836" end="2911863">Samuel Harrell/HOU/EES@EES</span>,<span type="person" start="2911865" end="2911893">Ross Mesquita/NA/Enron@ENRON</span>cc : Subject : Retail power RFQs on DealBench<span type="person" start="2911942" end="2911951">John We</span>very much enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing opportunities for EES and DealBench to work together .As we discussed, this email will

email confirmation from you, your team will be able to add deals to the 
DealBench platform.3-month access as a standard user (15 sealed-bid deals with up to 10 lots for 
each deal) .Months utilitzed do not need to be consecutive, but if a deal 
is up on DealBench in any day during a calendar month, that month will be 
inlcuded as part of the three month period.EES will pay DealBench a fee of $22,500, with $7,500 due immediately, $7,500 
due February 28th, and $7,500 due March 31st.We would like to debit your RC 
directly to avoid billing overheads.EES will solely control and be responsible for all business transactions that 
it conducts on the DealBench platform.As such, DealBench assumes no 
liability for any EES business transactions conducted on DealBench.We believe you will realize significant value from DealBench and look forward 
to working with you.As you know, I am going to be happy when we do a Live 
Auction for you and save you some significant money.Please confirm, with 
your RC number that you are IN with this arrangement.We also would want to 
explore further the larger opportunity - I will try to allocate some-one to 
work on that one with you next week.Regards ,<span type="person" start="2913401" end="2913430">Harry Arora Message-ID</span>: &lt;2732874.1075848344191.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Fri, 2 Feb 2001 06:59:00 -0800 (PST)

?Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval.About 10 minutes 
into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on 
the View Deal page.Within minutes, users reported the same problem 
reentering the Sabre deal.The rest of the site was unaffected
?Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management 
subsystem of DealBench.Solution Attempts:
?Restart the process that returns documents
?Move the documents off the deal
Solution:
?Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the 
documents.?The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.Once 
started, it continued without further errors through several auction 
extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.Cause
?Document management process stopped returning documents and was instead 
returning null values.This caused the View Deal page to appear "hung".The 
Document to be served was the "deal agent logo", a special document type that 
is displayed at the top of the page.Contributing Factors
?The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, 
was not logging its status
?The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly 
handle the special case of a document file being moved.Therefore, moving 
the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.?run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running 
consistently for over 60 days.Therefore it was not initially suspected as a 
problem source.Fixes
?An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system 
stability has been addressed
?Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly 
test all possible failure scenarios.?Start logging and tracking of run.batscript and document management process
?Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in 
the event of error
?Increase monitoring on new log files
?Initiate an in-depth architectural review with<span type="person" start="2916587" end="2916601">Kevin Montagne</span>'s team , to identify further areas to improve system robustnessMessage-ID : &lt;27179011.1075848343084.JavaMail .evans@thyme&gt;Date: Wed, 29 Nov 2000 10:20:00 -0800 (PST)

I got your name (and email address) from Chad Muir and was hoping to arrange 
a time to briefly (and informally) talk to you about Yahoo's B2B business 
strategy and whether you think there might be any opporunities to discuss 
some strategic relationship between Yahoo and Enron Net Works's DealBench 
subsidiary.Without getting into too many details, DealBench is an ASP addressing the 
needs of large, secure, sophisticated transaction participants.We are 
currently offering live online auctioning capabilities, online virtual 
datarooms and certain deal areas for the syndication of bank products and 
lease portfolios.We have completed transactions with nominal value of over 
$4 Billion since launching the site 4 months ago.My initial thought is 
that this could potentially fit in nicely with what I believe is Yahoo's need 
for recurring transaction-based revenues in certain B2B areas.Hopefully we can find time to talk soon.Take care ,<span type="person" start="2918126" end="2918162">Jeff Jeffrey M.

I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday.Enron Global Assets is considering using DealBench for hosting virtual 
datarooms for the divestiture of 32 international assets.The projected total 
number of documents will be in the region of 3500.DealBench has offered to 
host these datarooms at a cost of $25k per dataroom.This is on the basis 
that you are hosting all 32 datarooms, as we have worked some steep discounts 
into the pricing.The term of the dataroom hosting services under this offer 
is for the year 2001.We have also offered to help with the transition of the data to the improved 
dataroom platform once that is in place sometime in Q2.You have mentioned that a few documents that you intend to upload are bigger 
than 8MB.We have discussed that we can lift the current file size ceiling to 
greater than 8MB.I just want to make you aware that for users of the 
platform with slower connections it will be extremely time consuming to 
download these files.Even under ideal circumstances it will take al least 5 
minutes for a 15MB file to download.For users with slower connections it 
will potentially seem like the download has failed, even though the download 
is still in progress.This could result in a lot of calls to you and our 
help-desk.As I mentioned it might be of value to you to have professional assistance 
with the conversion of your paper documents to PDF.We are working together 
with a company in Houston that could help in the conversion process.From our 
experience file size and quality of scans are greatly improved by outsourcing 
this function.This is especially true if one is performing an OCR process on 
the TIFF files during conversion to PDF.In the light of the urgency of your projects it might be a good idea to start 
the dataroom preparation process as soon as possible.May I ask why you 
suggested to wait until March to get back in contact with us ?If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at 713-345-4147.We are 
very excited in helping you to deliver a world class solution.Thanks

Tobias Munk

There has been some concern about the lack of clarity regarding what 
functionality is ready for user acceptance testing in the staging 
environment.To attempt to solve this problem, we have come up with a simple 
process that will enhance communication and will allow everyone on the team 
to know what functionality is in staging waiting for user acceptance signoff 
prior to a release to production.Please read the attached one page document 
that details the proposed process.Let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,
Zach
