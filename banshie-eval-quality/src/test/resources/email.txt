Western Power Prices Fall With Warmer Weather, Natural Gas Loss

     Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western spot
power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather
across the region and declining natural gas prices.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest
temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.
     At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell
$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.
     "What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were
supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the
weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower."
     Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,
and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.
     Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the
El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.
     "Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices
to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased
$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell
to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.
     PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant
was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled
to restart this weekend.
     At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at
$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas

     Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day
power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and
falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western
PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades
ranging from $62.00-$76.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures
could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.
     "Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of
the morning," said one PJM-based trader. "By options expiration
the market had pretty much dried up."
     Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main
reason for the decline in spot market prices.
     Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the
New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million
British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since
Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of
$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts
indicated reduced utility load requirements.
     In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they
normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather
forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.
     Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13
higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the
$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-
$92.00.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices

     Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised
warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the
Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19
to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the
market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on
the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower
on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17
lower at $65.00-$100.00.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal
in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven
days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.
     Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled
prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent
electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired
generation to meet increased weather-related demand.
     Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average
of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British
thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average
of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.
     "The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got
people coming to their senses," one trader said. "These are much
more realistic prices."
     Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the
outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for
delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00
yesterday.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged
with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission
capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in
southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.
     "What's happening is the people who don't have firm
transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those
high prices since they have no choice," one MAPP trader said.
     "Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a
firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices
fell off," he said, "and bought from them at those lower prices,
causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade."

Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast

     Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast
U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was
forecast for the region this week, traders said.
     Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since
many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures
climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.
     "There was nothing going on in Florida today," said one
southern energy trader. "Everything was going to markets in the
north."
     Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into
markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority
grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.
     "Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as
forecasts came out," said on Entergy power trader. "Prices,
declined to $60 and less."
     The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95
to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades
were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent
estimates.
     Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather
forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week
caused prices to decline in the region.
     In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was
the main culprit behind lower prices.
     "The cold weather's backing off," said one SPP utility
trader. "It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and
today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was
bitter cold and today it was just plain cold."
     Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though
the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern
SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.

U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand

     London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in
the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to
increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.
     The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the
Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees
to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services
Corp. in the U.S.
     Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15
pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.
     December continued to fall amid a combination of position
closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will
not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.
     December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.
     First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with
expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue
to stifle demand, traders said.
     January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a
megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.
     First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.
     Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer
2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.
Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a
megawatt-hour.
     Open positions on many short-term structures will likely
force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-
up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will
probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more
easily be assessed.

Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast

     Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices
on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today
as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.
     Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-
hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076
megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446
megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after
forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for
next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent
reservoirs from overflowing.
     Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise
with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for
space heating.
     Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active
trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders
said.
     "The market's been waiting for this day for a long time," a
Stockholm-based trader said. "For too long, people have been
selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should
now see a noticeable increase in the spot price."
     Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall
below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited
chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S.
     The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was
expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict
temperatures to begin falling.
     Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22
percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell
4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.
     Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise
by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.
     Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-
term contracts.
     Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,
1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a
megawatt-hour.
     Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although
expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers
to meet the increased demand, other traders said.
     Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,
will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.
     Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used
today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

Westgate

Enclosed are demographics on the Westgate site from Investor's Alliance.
Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package
on San Marcos that you received earlier.
If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know.
Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?

San Marcos
The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for
sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square
foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West
San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.

Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes
and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25
per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and
$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This
property will have the best location for student housing of all new
projects, just as the duplexes do now.

If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there
is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not
yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will
know more on this question later today.

Sincerely,

George W. Richards

Liane,

 As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to 
manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  It appears that a single 
buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above 
market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, 
offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were 
bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index 
calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated 
financial swaps for San Juan.

 We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from 
September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from 
Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage 
firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a 
trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas 
daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread 
relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:

 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater 
than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 

 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & 
Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and 
       October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that 
are dramatically different.


 I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the 
trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to 
determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are 
outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in 
establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at 
$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the 
calculation of index.

 It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to 
conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me 
anytime I can assist you towards this goal.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?"  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Subject: closing



Jeff, 
?
Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding 
as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like 
anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate 
closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? 
?
If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is 
no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? 
?
I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and 
find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.
?
I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable 
document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? 
This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last 
night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said 
this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? 
?
I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at 
that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even 
needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any 
need to contact me regarding the  closing.
?
I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself 
and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't 
seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my 
signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it 
reviewed before I accept it.
?
Brenda

George,

 Below is a list of questions that Keith and I had regarding the Westgate 
project:

 Ownership Structure

 What will be the ownership structure? Limited partnership? General partner?

 What are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what 
capacity(regarding ownership and 
 liabilities)?

 Who owns the land? improvements?

 Who holds the various loans?

 Is the land collateral?

 Investment
 
 What happens to initial investment?

 Is it used to purchase land for cash?Secure future loans?
 
 Why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement?

 When is the 700,000 actually needed? Now or for the land closing? Investment 
schedule?

 Investment Return

 Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?

 Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits 
are distributed?

 Debt

 Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral 
is associated with each 
 loan?

 Improvement

 Construction

 Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.

 Terms of each loan?

 Uses of Funds

 How will disbursements be made?  By whom?

 What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing 
for investors?

 Reports to track expenses vs plan?

 Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?

 What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get 
paid a markup on subcontractors as a 
 general contractor and paid gain out of profits?

 Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses 
before the ultimate payout of profits?

 Design and Construction
 
 When will design be complete?

 What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?

 What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction 
planning and permitting?

 Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, 
vendors, and other professionals? 
 Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?

 Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to 
use? Names?

These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor 
in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as
much as possible from the process.

Phillip

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

George,

 Here sales numbers from Reagan:

 
 

 As you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot.  The 
1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the 
units you are selling.  At  2.7 MM, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units 
under construction.  I am having a hard time justifying paying much more with 
competition on the way.  The price I am bidding is higher than any deals 
actually done to date.   

 Let me know what you think.  I will follow up with an email and phone call 
about Cherry Creek.  I am sure Deborah Yates let you know that the bid was 
rejected on the De Ville property.

Jeff,

 I need to see the site plan for Burnet.  Remember I must get written 
approval from Brenda Key Stone before I can sell this property and she has 
concerns about the way the property will be subdivided.    I would also like 
to review the closing statements as soon as possible.

Lucy,

I want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. I faxed you a copy 
of this file.  You can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct 
amounts and I will input.

Brenda,

 I checked my records and I mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on 
August 28th.  I mailed it to 4303 Pate Rd. #29, College Station, TX 77845.  I 
will go ahead and mail you another check.  If the first one shows up you can 
treat the 2nd as payment for October.

 I know your concerns about the site plan.  I will not proceed without 
getting the details and getting your approval.

 I will find that amortization schedule and send it soon.

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.

Jeff,

 I received the rent roll.  I am going to be in San Marcos this weekend but I 
am booked with stage coach.  I will drive by Friday evening.
 I will let you know next week if I need to see the inside.  Can you find out 
when Chelsea Villa last changed hands and for what price?

 What about getting a look at the site plans for the Burnet deal.  Remember 
we have to get Brenda happy.

Socal  36,600  37,200  -600

NWPL  -51,000  -51,250  250

San Juan -32,500  -32,000  -500


The reason the benchmark report shows net selling San Juan is that the 
transport positions were rolled in on 9/8.  This added 800 shorts to San Juan 
and 200 longs to Socal.  Before this adjustment we bought 300 San Juan and 
sold 800 Socal.

Jeff,

 You would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. 

  I am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which  
I might become involved with Creekside.  Are you in the business of brokering 
properties or contacts?  Is your position based on a legal or what you 
perceive to be an ethical issue?  Did you propose we look at developing a 
project from scratch?

 I am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.

Subject: Sagewood Town Homes


I was aware that Regan Lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot
duplex project, was selling his units in the $180's,  He does have a much
lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due
to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units.
We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of
the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq
footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his
sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell
for $203,108.
What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the
rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own
evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the
3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we
were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom
units along with the 3-bedroom plan.
Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.
Sincerely,
George W. Richards

Larry,

 Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development 
opportunities.

 I stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were 
built by Reagan Lehmann.  22 Units were sold for 
 around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex).  I spoke to Reagan and he indicated 
that he had more units under construction that would be 
 available in the 180's.  Are the units he is selling significantly different 
from yours?  He mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor
 plan.  My bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex.  

 As far as being an investor in a new project, I am still very interested.  

 Call or email with your thoughts.

Do not underestimate the effects of the Internet economy on load growth.  I 
have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year.  
The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the 
distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for 
power quality reasons.

The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due 
to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm 
trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months 
due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand, 
Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude 
awakening in the next 2-3 years.

Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on
                  Local Utilities 

                  ( September 05, 2000 ) 


                  In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus
                  Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in 
Tukwila. 

                       The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and 
computer servers for the
                  region's growing number of dot-coms. 

                       Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up 
construction
                  on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than 
a mile from its
                  original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several 
fiber optic backbones, the
                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and 
eventually
                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, 
Microsoft and Onvia.com. 

                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data 
centers near Seattle.
                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, 
Globix and
                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house 
the networking
                  equipment of the Internet economy. 

                       It is a big business that could have an effect on 
everything from your
                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access 
your favorite Web sites.

                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and 
server farms, are
                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent 
Valley that some
                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and 
Puget Sound
                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, 
high-security
                  facilities. 

                       "We are talking to about half a dozen customers that 
are requesting 445
                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall," 
said Karl
                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound 
Energy. "That is
                  the equivalent of six oil refineries." 

                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, 
the rise of the Internet
                  data center has some utility veterans scratching their 
heads. 

                       Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington 
Utilities and
                  Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new 
data centers. The
                  tariff is designed to protect the company's existing 
residential and business
                  customers from footing the bill for the new base stations 
necessary to support
                  the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 
million each,
                  Karzmar said. 

                       Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to 
bring up the data center
                  issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. 

                       For the utilities that provide power to homes, 
businesses and schools in the
                  region, this is a new and complex issue. 

                       On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing 
appetite for power --
                  represent potentially lucrative business customers. The 
facilities run 24 hours a
                  day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a 
constant revenue
                  stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that 
they could
                  potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital 
expenditures. 

                       Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will 
mean for power rates
                  in the area is still open to debate. 

                       "These facilities are what we call extremely dense 
loads," said Bob Royer,
                  director of communications and public affairs at Seattle 
City Light. 

                       "The entire University of Washington, from stadium 
lights at the football
                  game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. 
We have data
                  center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 
and 50 megawatts." 

                       With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate 
complex in Tukwila is
                  one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased 
the 1.35 million
                  square-foot Intergate East facility last September from 
Boeing Space &
                  Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased 
92 percent of the
                  six-building complex to seven different co-location 
companies. 

                       "It is probably the largest data center park in the 
country," boasts Laurent
                  Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG 
Communications,
                  NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama 
Networks all
                  lease space in the office park. 

                       After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997, 
Sabey has become an
                  expert in the arena and now has facilities either under 
management or
                  development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole 
claims his firm is
                  one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in 
the country. 

                       As more people access the Internet and conduct 
bandwidth-heavy tasks
                  such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for 
co-location space in
                  Seattle continues to escalate. 

                       But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center 
space is growing at a
                  rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, 
causing similar
                  concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and 
California. 

                       Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location 
space, plans to nearly
                  double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. 
While companies
                  such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many 
high-tech companies
                  have decided to outsource the operations to companies such 
as Exodus that
                  may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic 
management. 

                       "We have 2 million square feet of space under 
construction and we plan to
                  double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more 
demand right now
                  than data center space," said Steve Porter, an account 
executive at Exodus in
                  Seattle. 

                       The booming market for co-location space has left some 
in the local utility
                  industry perplexed. 

                       "It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do 
to serve the growth,"
                  said Seattle City Light's Royer. "The utility industry is 
almost stunned by this, in
                  a way."

We have not received your completed Team Selection information.  It is

Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

Richard,

 Compare your california production to the numbers in the 2000 California Gas 
Report.  It shows 410.  But again that might be just what the two utilities

Subject: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence Program


Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
Selection information.

Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
require additional information.

We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.

So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
to instead, provide the needed information via email.

Thank you for your assistance Phillip.

 Got your message.  Good luck on the bike ride.

 What were you doing to your apartment?  Are you setting up a studio?

 The kids are back in school.  Otherwise just work is going on here.

Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the "socalprices" spread sheet 
supposed to be in $?  If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where 
did they come from?  I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter.  We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.  It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the 
whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.

Thanks.

Mark,

 Attached is a spreadsheet that lists the end of day midmarkets for socal 
basis and socal/san juan spreads.  I listed the days during bidweek that 
reflected financial trading for Socal Index and the actual gas daily prints 
before and after bidweek.  



 




 The following observations can be made:

  July 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs 
actual of .79
   2.  Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91
   3.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

  Aug. 1.  The basis market  anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs 
actual of .99
   2.  Perceived index was 4.54 vs actual of 4.49
   3.  Gas daily spreads were much wider before and after bidweek than the 
monthly postings
   4.  Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.

   

 Enron Online will allow you to monitor the value of financial swaps against 
the index, as well as, spreads to other locations.  Please call with any 
questions.

Phillip

Brad,

 With regard to Tori Kuykendall, I would like to promote her to commercial 
manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an 
associate.  Her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a 
commercial manager.  I have no doubt that she will compare favorably to 
others in that category at year end.  

 Martin Cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as Tori.  
Hunter would like Martin handled the same as Tori.

 Let me know if there are any issues.

Lucy,

 The rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better.  See if you can add 
these modifications:

 1.  Use a formula in column E.  Add the value in column C to column D.  It 
should read =c6+d6.  Then copy this formula to the rows below.

 2.  Column H needs a formula.  Subtract amount paid from amount owed.  
=e6-g6.

 3.  Column F is filled with the #### sign.  this is because the column width 
is too narrow.  Use you mouse to click on the line beside the 
       letter F.  Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.

 4.  After we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to 
this sheet and place them to the right in columns J and beyond.

Lucy,

 We can discuss your email later.  How is progress on creating the 
spreadsheets.  You will probably need to close the file before you attach to 
an email.  It is 2:00.  I really want to make some progress on these two 
files.

Open the "utility" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it 
is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (LP-1).
You will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months.  If we 
have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper.  Use the rates 
described in the spreadsheet.  This is a great chance for you to practice 
excel.

Mac,

 Thanks for the research report on EOG.  Here are my observations:

  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year
  
  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf

  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. 

   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:
  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS 
X 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share


 That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think 
crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.

 Current price 37
 Nat. Gas 34
 Crude  10

 Total  81

 
 Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil's advocate?  To me this 
looks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, 
Tosco, and SLB?


Thank you,

 Phillip

I checked into exercising options with Smith Barney, but Enron has some kind 
of exclusive with Paine Weber.  I am starting to exercise now, but I am going 
to use the proceeds to buy another apartment complex.   
 What do you think about selling JDSU and buying SDLI?
 Also can you look at EOG as a play on rising oil and gas prices.

Thanks,

Cooper,

 Did you add some more security to the expost hourly summary?  It keeps 
asking me for additional passwords and domain.  What do I need to enter?

Subject: TRANSPORTATION MODEL

Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
discuss them.

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

--  NET RADIO SITE OF THE DAY  --
Today: Lost in the cosmos of Net-radio stations? Sorry, this site
will probably only add to the confusion. FMcities houses over 1,350
stations in North America, organized by city. Sound daunting? It
is... but here's the good part - every site listed here is 100-
percent commercial-free. That's right, nothing but the good stuff.

Lucy,

 Now that #44 is rented and you have settled in for a couple of months, we 
need to focus on expenses and recordkeeping.

 First, I want to implement the following changes:

  1.  No Overtime without my written (or email) instructions.
  2.  Daily timesheets for you and Wade faxed to me daily
  3.  Paychecks will be issued each Friday by me at the State Bank
  4.  No more expenditures on office or landscape than is necessary for basic 
operations.


 Moving on to the checkbook, I have attached a spreadsheet that organizes all 
the checks since Jan. 1.
 When you open the file, go to the "Checkbook" tab and look at the yellow 
highlighted items.  I have questions about these items.
 Please gather receipts so we can discuss.

Phillip

curves each night.

Here is an example that pulls socal only.

Subject: Price for Stanfield Term

I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
give me a basis for the period :

Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
Sept-00 - May 31, 2008

Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
be on these terms.

Thanks, Mike

Wade,

 I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle 
situation.  You need to take care of it this week.  Lucy can't hold the 
tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers) 
if the staff doesn't live up to it.  If you decide to buy a small truck and 
you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your 
income.

Subject: El Paso Blanco Avg product,



Please extend all internal gas traders view access to the new El Paso Blanco 
Avg physical NG product.

Tori Kuykendahl and Jane Tholt should both have administrative access to 
manage this on EOL.

If you have any questions, please call me on 3-7041

Thanks,

Phillip Allen

Kay,

 I will be down that weekend, but I am not sure about the rest of the family.
All is well here.  I will try to bring some pictures if I can't bring the 
real thing.

Mike--

Here are the net open Socal border positions we have for Elvis and Cactus.  
Let's try and set up a conference call with Phillip and John to talk about 
their offers at the back-end of their curves.

Roughly speaking, we are looking at a nominal 3750 MMBtu/d for 14 years from 
May 2010 on Elvis, and 3000 MMBtu/d on Cactus fromJune 2004 to April 2022. 

Andy

Hey Phillip,
I received your note from Celeste.  I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator and 
need for you to fill out the attached Needs Assessment form before I can send 
you any resumes.  Also, would you be interested in the new class?  Analysts 
start with the business units on Aug. 3rd and Assoc. start on Aug. 28th.  We 
are starting to place the Associates and would like to see if you are 
interested.  Please let me know.  

Once I receive the Needs Assessment back (and you let me know if you can wait 
a month,) I will be happy to pull a couple of resumes for your review.  If 
you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Tim,
 Matt sent you a email with his attempt to organize some of the cems and wscc 
data.  Tim H. expressed concern over the reliability of the wscc data.  I 
don't know if we should scrap the wscc or just keep monitoring in case it 
improves.  Let me know what you think.

Folks, you are the remaining officers of ENA that have not yet enrolled in 
this mandated training program.  It is ENA's goal to have all its officers

Lucy,

I got your email.  I didn't have time to finish it.  I will read it this 
weekend and ask my dad about the a/c's.  I am glad you are enjoying
the job.  This weekend I will mark up the lease and rules.  If I didn't 
mention this when I was there, the 4th is a paid holiday for you and Wade.  
Have a good weekend and I will talk to you next week.

Subject: (Reminder) Update GIS Information

This is a reminder !!!  If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS 
information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed 
as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days 
ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to 
call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.

With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees 
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to 
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee 
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the 
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC 
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their 
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education 
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is 
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to 
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com 
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would 
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned 
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please 
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.  

Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.

Mark,

We are currently back-testing the storage model. 
The enclosed version contains deltas and decision 
variable. 

You mentioned that you have resources to run the model. Please do so.
This will help us to gain experience with the market vs the
model.

I am going to distribute an article by Caminus, an software vendor.
The article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation
very well.  The Enron Research storage model  is a lot like that, although 
implementation may be
different.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

Dear Phillip,

Frogger is leaving shockwave.com soon...

Save it to your Shockmachine now! 

Every frog has his day - games, too. Frogger had a great run as an 
arcade classic, but it is leaving the shockwave.com pond soon. The 
good news is that you can download it to your Shockmachine and 
own it forever! 

Don't know about Shockmachine? You can download Shockmachine for free 
and save all of your downloadable favorites to play off-line, 
full-screen, whenever you want. 

Download Frogger by noon, PST on June 30th, while it's still on 
the site!

Scott,

 I emailed your question to a friend that works for the new company.  I think 
I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from 
him.  Basically, they will offer energy  online at a fixed price or some 
price that undercuts the current provider.  Then once their sales are large 
enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit.  
The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage 
the price risk.  This is my best guess.  I will get back to you with more.

Lucy,

 I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you 
email me his number I will call him.  
 I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him 
work orders for normal maintenance.

 I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary 
to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I 
 can guess your answer.

 I might stop by this Friday.

Subject: Thoughts on Presentation

It is a shame that the CAISO doesn't provide actual generation by unit.  The 
WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, 
which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes 
the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but 
there can be a siginificant difference between "scheduled" and "actual" 
generation.  You are pulling "scheduled."  If someone doesn't schedule their 
generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you 
will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california 
munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, 
if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply 
schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said 
all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on 
the generation side.

On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While 
they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is 
better than the "scheduled" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the 
load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.

I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with 
others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas 
demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, 
especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the 
UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal

Lucy,

 Click on this attachment to see the format to record expenses.  You can keep 
a log on paper or on the computer.  The computer would be better for sending 
me updates.

  

What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday.  This might be 
more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments.
We can adjust office hours on another day.

Jeff,

 I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion 
adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner 
financing would still work.   Do you have an opinion?

Al,

I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds 
like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your 
email all is well with you.   That's great.  

We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.  
What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike 
riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination.

My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on 
maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical 
cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.  
He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial 
Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the 
road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday.

I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch 
sometime.  

Phillip

Subject: Transport p&l

Phillip--
I've noticed one thing on your intra-month transport p&l that looks strange 
to me.  Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be 
an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is 
O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to 
get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and 
I'll take care of it..

On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate 
curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of 
$235,019.   
(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your 
overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects 
something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal 
#'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.
  139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)
  139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)
  139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)
  231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)
  153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)
 Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to 
GDP-Kingsgate.

 Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five 
different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for 
withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a 
Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is 
that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport 
losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  
I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a 
systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems 
that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, 
the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the 
detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it 
appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be 
an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar 
impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in 
case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the 
volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Mary,

If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6 
or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.  
12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you 
could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound 
fair?  We can apply it to the loan.

Any merit to mentioning that there has been an initial "supply" response in

Recognizing the time constraints you face, I've tried to 1) clear up a few 
inaccuracies and 2) massage some of the sharper language without taking a 
chainsaw to the otherwise good job.

  What are they going to do with the land

Subject: Large Deal Alert

To make a long story short.

Williams is long 4000MW of tolling in SP15 (SoCal )  for 20 years (I know I 
did the deal)
on Tuesday afternoon, Williams sold 1000 MW to Merrill Lynch for the 
remaining life (now 18 years)

Merrill is short fixed price gas at So Cal border  up to 250,000MMBtu a day 
and long SP15 power (1000 MW) a day.

heat rate 10,500  SoCal Border plus $0.50.

I'm not sure if MRL has just brokered this deal or is warehousing it.

For what its worth........

Subject: Re: SW Gas  

Mike McDonald and I met with SW Gas this morning.  They were polite regarding 
asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to 
listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to 
protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality 
agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable 
us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder 
value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by 
reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a 
weather product.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other 
candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy 
to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our 
opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we 
implement our strategy in California.

Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset 
management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to 
systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

 Did you meet with SWG on April 27th.  Are there any other asset management 
targets in the west?

Subject: SW Gas

Janie,

Thanks for the fax on SW Gas.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to 
discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to 
gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  
Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are 
typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  
How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main 
contacts at SW Gas?

We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our 
control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably 
have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the 
commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their 
commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) 
should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month 
index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That 
risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of 
their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.

As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are 
there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks,

Laird

Kay & Neal,

Thanks for remembering my birthday.  You beat my parents by one day.  

The family is doing fine.  Grace is really smiling.  She is a very happy baby 
as long as she is being held.

It sounds like your house is coming along fast.  I think my folks are ready 
to start building.  

We will probably visit in late June or July.  May is busy.  We are taking the 
kids to Disney for their birthdays.

Good luck on the house.

Mary,

I spoke to Gary about the foundation work on #2 & #3.  He agreed that it 
would be better to just clean up #3 and do whatever he and Wade can do to 
#2.  Then they can just focus on #19.  I worked on the books this weekend but 
I need more time to finish.  I will call you in a day or so.

I checked into executing my options with Smith Barney.  Bad news.  Enron has 
an agreement with Paine Webber that is exclusive.  Employees don't have the 
choice of where to exercise.  I still would like to get to the premier

Hopefully this will reach you.

Stephane,

 Can you create an e-mail list to distribute your reports everyday to the 
west desk?
Or put them on a common drive?  We can do the same with our reports.   List 
should include:

 Phillip Allen
 Mike Grigsby
 Keith Holst
 Frank Ermis
 Steve South
 Janie Tholt
 Tory Kuykendall
 Matt Lenhart
 Randy Gay

Thanks.

Will,


Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position 
and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that 
represent all the risk held by the desk
and estimate p&l with great accuracy.


Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items 
above.

Phillip

$100 for the yard seems like enough for up to 12.5 hours.  How long did it 
take him?  I think $100 should be enough. 

Use Page Setup under the File menu to change  from Portrait to Landscape if 
you want to change from printing vertically 
to printing horizontally.  Also try selecting Fit to one page if you want 
your print out to be on only one page.  Use Print preview
to see what your print out will look like before you print.

The truck might need new sparkplugs at around 120,000-125,000 miles.  A valve 
adjustment might do some good.  It has idled very high
for the last 25,000 miles, but it has never broken down.

Glad to hear about the good deposit for this week.  Great job on February.

Subject: REVISION - - LOAD AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES


Most control areas have now reported the amount of load relief and generation 
increase that was experienced over the Peak period (17:00-18:00 PST) on 
December 12.  The data I have received thus far are summarized in the 
following paragraphs.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or 
curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.

The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations 
or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.

A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a 
lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

Don Badley

tara,

 I received your email about setting up Paul Lucci and Niccole Cortez with

Why am I not surprised ?

I suspect that if someone were to build a town called Lime, make
everything in the town out of lime, provide only foods that have
some connection to lime and then bury the Limeys in lime when
they're dead, 'Arry would move to that town in a flash and think
that he had arrived in Paradise on Earth.

According to my v-a-a-a-ast network of spies, sneaks and sleuths,
this next issue of The Last Straw focusses on lime... and to no one's
surprise, will feature some of the musings/wisdom/experience of our
Master of Lime, 'Arry .

Those same spies/sneaks/sleuths tell me that the format of this
next issue is a departure from the norm and may be a Beeg Surprise
to some.

Me ?  My curiosity is piqued and am itchin' to see this Limey
issue of The Last Straw and if you are afflicted with the same and
do not yet subscribe, it may not be too late:

Folks,

I just found this interesting site about the history of the uses of lime and
development of pozzolonic materials ...lime and clay - Roman Cement -  that I
think will be interesting to the group.

I highly recommend David Moore's book "The Roman Pantheon" at $25.00  -   a
very thorough research into the uses and development of Roman Cement....lime
and clay/pozzolonic ash; the making and uses of lime in building. The book
covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.

I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -
interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years
learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,
structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have
lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good
background information for sustainable builder folks.

Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.

Mary,

 I got your email.  Go ahead and get a carpet shampooer.  Make sure it comes 
back clean after each use.  (Wade and the tenants.)

 As far as W-2.  I looked up the rules for withholding and social security.  
I will call you later today to discuss.

Phillip -
I applaud you for using your cycle as daily transportation.  Saves on gas, 
pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy.  Enron provides bike racks 
in the front of the building for requests such as this.  Phillip, I wish we 
could accommodate this request; however, The Body Shop does not have the 
capacity nor can assume the responsibility for storing cycles on a daily 
basis.  If you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike 
at the designated outside racks.  

Keep Pedalling - Lee

Julie,

 The numbers for January are below:

  Actual flows X gas daily spreads          $ 463,000
  Actual flow X Index spreads           $ 543,000
  Jan. value from original bid           $1,750,000
  Estimated cost to unwind hedges         ($1,000,000) 

 Based on these numbers, I suggest we offer to pay at least $500,000 but no 
more than $1,500,000.  I want your input on
 how to negotiate with El Paso.  Do we push actual value, seasonal shape, or 
unwind costs?  

Phillip

Subject: Choosing a style


I am planning to build a house in the Texas hillcountry.  The exterior will
be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back.  I am considering the
following features:  stained and scored concrete floors, an open
living/dining/kitchen concept, lots of windows, a home office, 4 bedrooms
all upstairs.  I want a very relaxed and comfortable style, but not exactly
country.  Can you help?

First one's free. So are the next thousand.

You know it's true: Video games are addictive. Sure, we could
trap you with a free game of Centipede, then kick up the price
after you're hooked. But that's not how shockwave.com operates.
Shockmachine -- the greatest thing since needle exchange -- is
now free; so are the classic arcade games. Who needs quarters?
Get Arcade Classics from shockwave.com, stick 'em in your
Shockmachine and then play them offline anytime you want.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lick the Frog.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You're not getting a date this Friday night. But you don't care.
You've got a date with Frogger. This frog won't turn into a handsome
prince(ss), but it's sure to bring back great memories of hopping
through the arcade -- and this time, you can save your quarters for
laundry. Which might increase your potential for a date on Saturday.
http://shockwave1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H430297053X351630

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Business Meeting or Missile Command? You Decide.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Take it offline! No, it's not a horrible meeting with your boss -
it's Missile Command. Shockmachine has a beautiful feature: you can
play without being hooked to the Internet. Grab the game from
shockwave.com, save it to your hard drive, and play offline! The
missiles are falling. Are you ready to save the world?
http://shockwave1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H430297053X351631

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"I Want to Take You Higher!"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wanna get high? Here's your chance to do it at home - Shockmachine
lets you play your favorite arcade games straight from your computer.
It's a chance to crack your old high score. Get higher on Centipede -
get these bugs off me!
http://shockwave1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H430297053X351632

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Souls for Sale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The '80s may not have left many good memories, but at least we still
have our Atari machines. What? You sold yours for a set of golf
clubs? Get your soul back, man! Super Breakout is alive and well and
waiting for you on Shockmachine. Now if you can just find that record
player and a Loverboy album...
http://shockwave1.m0.net/m/s.asp?H430297053X351633

Playing Arcade Classics on your Shockmachine -- the easiest way to
remember the days when you didn't have to work. If you haven't
already, get your free machine now.

Naomi,

The two analysts that I have had contact with are Matt Lenhart  and Vishal 
Apte.
Matt will be represented by Jeff Shankman.
Vishal joined our group in October.  He was in the Power Trading Group for 
the first 9 months.
I spoke to Jim Fallon and we agreed that he should be in the excellent 
category.  I just don't want Vishal 
to go unrepresented since he changed groups mid year.

Call me with questions.(x37041)

Western Power Spot Prices Sink Amid Weather-Related Demand

     Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.
spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply
outstripped demand.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak
power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-
hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.
     "Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing
prices to decline," said one Southwest trader.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach
75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank
$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as
traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.
     Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt
Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased
production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a
scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.
     At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power
slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a
Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling
demand 84 percent below normal.
     "We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is
causing temperatures to drop," said one Northwest trader.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at
$175.00-$228.00.
     According the California Independent System Operator today's
forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743
megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.

Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand

     Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in
available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,
caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much
as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree
Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and
cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak
power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg
volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from
Friday.
     "There's just no weather out there," said one PJM-based
trader. "There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for
heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week
long."
     Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000
megawatts through Friday.
     Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for
the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to
service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to
hit the grid tomorrow.
     Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2
nuclear power facilities.
     The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1
at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of
a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at
full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned
and operated by Niagara Mohawk.
     Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to
$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to
$51.25 and $40.00 indices.

Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high
weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,
traders said.
     "It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee
Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy
to there," one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.
"Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of
that."
     The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose
$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25
when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.
     Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00
and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the
Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.
     Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at
$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,
forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.
     "Things should continue along these lines for the rest of
the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not
so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices," an
ECAR trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from
the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,
though traders said transmission problems limited volume.
     Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the
Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,
and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with
trades from $32.00-$40.00.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also
climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as
above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems
isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.
     For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern
MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern
half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.
     Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.
predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in
Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.
     "There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems
getting power out of Ameren's grid too," one MAPP trader said.
"It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and
down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool)."

Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up

     Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to
major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.
     Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta
vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5
degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is
expected to begin Wednesday.
     Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,
temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,
propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.
      The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council
regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from
equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.
Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.
     On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an
average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid
trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.
     In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm
energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders
complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.
     "There's just no overnight load to do anything with the
supply we have," said one Texas-based utility power trader.
"Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree
(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is
85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us."
     On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for
tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done
at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders
said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South
starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at
$35-$36.
     Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy
at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because
power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.
     Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg
index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.
     In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the
balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later
trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy
power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders
said.
     On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was
bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for
the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades
were noted.

U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids

     London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.
fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling
interest, traders said.
     Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a
megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before
closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than
Friday.
     The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of
the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one
trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was
short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition
from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting
price levels, traders said.
     Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was
expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production
costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.
     June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after
last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas
futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15
pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since
the start of last week.
     Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental
reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the
market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.
Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,
they said.

Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest

     Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term
electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed
to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid
limited hydro-supply, traders said.
     Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all
time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00
megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-
214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     "The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now
you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo-
based trader said. "I'm surprised that even at the peak of the
snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are
steadily climbing.''
     Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent
above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.
Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a "more
realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet
outlooks.''
     Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations
of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,
down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was
a "high'' spot price for this time of the year.
     Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour
with 140 megawatts exchanged.
     Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours
generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.

Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay 
something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and 
a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock 
will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put 
up new rock then we will need to clarify.

Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the 
negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the 
utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.

Due to some problems with my email yesterday, I may not have received your 
RSVP.....please excuse any confusion this may have caused.


RSVP REQUESTED!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy 
Meeting" on Friday, May 18 to discuss global emissions issues -- such as air 
quality regulation, climate change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and 
explore some of the potential business opportunities for Enron commercial 
groups.

WHEN:  Friday, May 18
TIME:   10:00 am - 3:00 pm - lunch will be provided
WHERE:  Enron Building, 8C1 (8th floor)

A video conference is being organized to enable broad participation from the 
London office and a teleconference will be set up for others who would like

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  
Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding 
the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business 
meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is 
even desired or necessary.

As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try 
and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working 
and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet 
just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a 
round table discussion format.  

My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and 
jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

Reagan,

Just wanted to give you an update.  I have changed the unit mix to include 
some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is 
working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA 
financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to 
you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still 
attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.

Jim,

Is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about 
all the regulatory issues facing California this week?  Can you make sure the 
gas desk is included.

Subject: 4-URGENT - OWA Please print this now.


Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all 
of the "stupid regulatory/legislative decisions" since the beginning of the 
year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next 
week's "Ken Lay Tour" to CA.  

He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get 
these three documents by Monday afternoon?

Phillip--To the extent that we can give Chair Hoecker our spin on the reasons 
for the hikes, we would like to.  The Commission is getting calls from 
legislators, DOE, etc. about the prices and is going to have to provide some 
response.  Better if it coincides with Enron's view and is not anti-market.  
We still haven't decided what we will provide.  You definitely will be 
included in that discussion once we get the numbers from accounting.  Thanks.

Tim,

Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz.  He is our 
Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract.

On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its 
forecast for McNary discharge during May.  It seems like the flows have been 
lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170.  Also the 
second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected.  The 
outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary.  Can you email or call with some 
additional insight?

Thank you,

Gary,

I have also been speaking to Johnnie Brown in San Antonio to be the general 
contractor.  According to Johnnie, I would not be pay any less buying from 
the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within 
his region.  Assuming this is true, I will work directly with him.  I believe 
he has sent you my plans.  They were prepared by Kipp Flores architects.  

Can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from 
the distributor?  If you have the estimates worked up for Johnnie will you 
please email them to me as well?

Thank you for your time.  I am excited about potentially using your product.

Is there any detail on the gas cost proxy.  Which delivery points from which 
publication will be used?  Basically, can you help us get any clarification 
on the language "the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in 
California"?

Ned,

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for 
this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current 
summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made 
to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal 
capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and 
withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 
existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above 
assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email 
with comments.

Phillip Allen

Subject: Re: This morning's Commission meeting delayed  

Phil,  I suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed 
doors "in smoke filled rooms", if not directly between Commissioners then 
among FERC staffers.  Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large 
part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which 
the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman 
began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or 
answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had 
some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:

Price caps are almost never the right answer
Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages
Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer
Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce 
demand, is not acceptable
Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would 
export California's problems to the West

This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty 
strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner 
out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and 
if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the 
agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray

Gary,

Here is a photograph of a similar house.  The dimensions would be 56'Wide X 
41' Deep for the living area.  In addition there will be a 6' deep two story 
porch across the entire back and 30' across the front.  A modification to the 
front will be the addition of a gable across 25' on the left side.  The 
living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the 
front porch.  

I don't have my floor plan with me at work today, but will bring in tomorrow 
and fax you a copy.

The implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially 
set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position.  Whatever 
the risk was prior should not matter.  Since the rest of the books are very 
short price this should be a large offset.  If the VAR calculation does not 
match the company's true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted.

It is bidweek again.  I need to provide view only ID's to the two major

to the following:

Dexter Steis at Natural Gas Intelligence- dexter@intelligencepress.com

Bidweek is under way so it is critical that these id's are sent out asap.

Johnnie,

Thank you for meeting with me on Friday.  I left feeling very optimistic 
about the panel system.  I would like to find a way to incorporate the panels 
into the home design I showed you.  In order to make it feasible within my 
budget I am sure it will take several iterations.  The prospect of purchasing 
the panels and having your  framers install them may have to be considered.  
However, my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor.

I realize you receive a number of calls just seeking information about this 
product with very little probability of a sale.  I just want to assure you 
that I am going to build this house in the fall and I would seriously 
consider using the panel system if it truly was only a slight increase in 
cost over stick built.

Please email your cost estimates when complete.

Thank you,

Phillip AllenMessage-ID: <28834319.1075855694852.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Chad,

Call Ted Bland about the trading track program.  All the desks are trying to 
use this program to train analysts to be traders.  Your experience should 
help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. Unless you 
are dying to do another rotation is risk.

Here is a simplistic spreadsheet.  I didn't drop in the new generation yet, 
but even without the new plants it looks like Q3 is no worse than last year.
Can you take a look and get back to me with the bullish case?

thanks,

Larry,

It sounds like Claudia and Jacques are almost finished with the documents.  
There is one item of which I was unsure.  Was an environmental
report prepared before the original purchase?  If yes, shouldn't it be listed 
as an asset of the partnership and your costs be recovered?

Bruce,

Thank you for your bid.  I have decided on a floor plan.  I am going to have 
an architect in Austin draw the plans and help me work up a detailed 
specification list.  I will send you that detailed plan and spec list when 
complete for a final bid.  Probably in early to mid June.

Subject: CAISO demand reduction

Phillip et al.,

I have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in 
the West.  Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. 
March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand 
over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for 
temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates 
into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as 
compared with the previous year.

Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary 
reductions (as opposed to "forced" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other 
forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making 
total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  
This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple 
more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% 
decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the 
retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it 
is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last 
year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in 
Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation 
are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of 
meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general 
economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least 
make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.

Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area 
only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC 
(U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO 
portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in 
demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As 
you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum 
smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at 
least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its 
wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several 
mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are 
sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly 
how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  
Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's 
economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of 
the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I 
think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already 
realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the 
non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the 
WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 
6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.

I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you 
with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I 
hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any 
questions or need any further information.

Lucy,

Here is the rentroll from last friday.  

The closing was to be this Thursday but it has been delayed until Friday 
April 20th.  If you can stay on until April 20th that would be helpful.  If 
you have made other commitments I understand.

Gary is planning to put an A/C in #35. 

You can give out my work numer (713) 853-7041

            We are spending Christmas in Houston with Heather's sister.  We 
are planning to come to San Marcos for New Years.  

            How long will you stay?  what are your plans?  Email me with 
latest happenings with you in the big city.

Reagan,

I sent you an email last week stating that I would be in San Marcos on 
Friday, April 13th.  However, my closing has been postponed.  As I mentioned 
I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get 
back in touch with you once he is finished.

Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager 
from San Antonio.  For my first development project, I feel more comfortable 
with their experience obtaining FHA financing.  We are working with Kipp 
Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings.  Your bid 
for the construction is competive with other construction estimates.  I am 
still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local 
relationships.  I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final 
determination on unit mix and site plan.

Jacques,

The amounts needed to fill in the blanks on Exhibit "B" are as follows:

Kipp Flores-Total Contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 
is outstanding.

Kohutek- $2,150 

Cuatro- $37,800


George & Larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and I agreed to reimburse this 
amount.

The total cash that Keith and I will pay the Sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 
appraisal and $2,375 engineering).    I couldn't find any reference to this 
cash consideration to be paid by the buyers.

Let me know if I need to do anything else before you can forward this to the  
sellers to be executed.

Phillip

Regarding the employment agreement, Mike declined without a counter.  Keith 
said he would sign for $75K cash/$250 equity.  I still believe Frank should 
receive the same signing incentives as Keith.

Thanks for the response.  I think you are right that engaging an architect is 
the next logical step.  I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the 
floor plan.
He got back to me yesterday with his first draft.  He took my plan and 
improved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While 
he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification 
list.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and 
speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday 
April 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through 
that day?  Also can you provide some references?

Once I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust 
your bid.

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Lucy,

Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.  My only questions are:

1.  Neil Moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 
12/01.  Even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the 
beginning 
     of the two week period.  What is going on?

2.  Gilbert in #27-is he just late?

I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Have you ever seen anyone 
miss as much work as I have in the last 6 weeks?  I assure you this is 
unusual for me.
Hopefully we can sign some documents on Monday.  Call me on my cell phone if 
you need me.

Reagan,

I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.

Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?

What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 
221(d) loans?  

Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market 
quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:

  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment
  2%- overhead
  4%- profit

I just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an 
extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even 
reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only 
generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about 
such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down 
to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?

I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you 
local connections.  I am not discounting those services.   I will be out of 
the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.

Phillip

Cary,

Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.

A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:

There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
No dormers (Metal roof)
1/2 bath under stairs
Overall dimensions are 55 by 40


What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
Reagan
suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
bringing the left
side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
porch would
be smaller.

I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
builder.
I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
allowed.

Reagan,

Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.  Below is a 
list of questions on the specs:

1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less 
and cost about the same?

2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory 
joist?

3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?

4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What 
type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or 
Cellulose?

5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?

6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know 
the difference between an apron and a stool.

7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent 
cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?

8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial 
one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.

9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under 
the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.

10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount 
stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.

11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.

12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?

13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?

14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron 
railings?

15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except 
for change orders?

I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but 
this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to 
call Cary Kipp to
see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.

Phillip

Jacques,

Would it be ok if I signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and 
architect?  They have both sent me agreements.  The only payment
that George and Larry had made was $2,350 to the architect.  I have written 
personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the 
engineer.
I was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the 
partnership.  

I would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the 
partnership not with me.  Should I wait until the partnership has been 
conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership.

Let me know what you think.

Greg,

Here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates:

Cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf 
(rentable)

What do the cost for On-Site General Requirements ( $299,818) represent?

Will you review the builders profit and fees with me again?  You mentioned 2% 
overhead, 3 %  ???, and 5% profit.

Why is profit only 4%? 

Why are the architect fees up to $200K.  I thought they would be $80K.

What is the $617K of profit allowance?  Is that the developers profit to 
boost loan amount but not a real cost?

Total Closing and Application costs of 350K?  That seems very high?  Who 
receives the 2 points?  How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?

Where is your 1%?  Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?

What is the status on the operating pro forma?  My back of the envelope puts 
NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% 
expenses.  After debt service that would only leave $122K.  The coverage 
would only be 1.16.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Phillip

John,

Mike is fine with signing a new contract (subject to reading the terms, of 
course).  He prefers to set strikes over a 3 month period.  His existing 
contract pays him a retention payment of $55,000 in the next week.  He still 
wants to receive this payment.

Reagan,

 Here is a photograhph of the house I have in mind.

 Specific features include:

 Stained and scored concrete floors downstairs
 Wood stairs
 Two story porches on front and rear
 Granite counters in kitchens and baths
 Tile floors in upstairs baths
 Metal roof w/ gutters (No dormers)
 Cherry or Maple cabinets in kitchen & baths
 Solid wood interior doors
 Windows fully trimmed
 Crown molding in downstairs living areas
 2x6 wall on west side

 Undecided items include:

 Vinyl or Aluminum windows
 Wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room
 Exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim  or rough white brick on 3-4 
sides
 
 
 I have faxed you the floor plans.  The dimensions may be to small to read.  
The overall dimensions are 55' X 40'.  For a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, 
but 
 only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage.  

 Are there any savings in the simplicity of the design?  It is basically a 
box with a simple roof 
 line.  Call me if you have any questions. 713-853-7041.

Greg,

Something that I forgot to ask you.  Do you know if Hugo is planning to 
replatt using an administrative process which I understand is quicker than 
the full replatting process of 3 weeks?

Also let me know about the parking.  The builder in San Marcos believed the 
plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code.  The townhomes 
across the street have a serious parking problem.  They probably planned for 
the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms.

Jacques,

The agreement looks fine.   My only comment is that George and Larry might 
object to the language that "the bank that was requested to finance the 
construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs 
of the construction of the Project".   Technically, that bank lowered the 
loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of 
equity that would be required. 

Did I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.

Regarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, 
engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are 
in a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking 
directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on 
what is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  

The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.  Do we 
need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset  and 
give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor.

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,"
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

Power Plants
(This article was originally published Wednesday)

   By Jessica Berthold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,"
Thomas said. "It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
"We've been doing all we can to get back in service," Lednicky said. "We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited."
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

Greg,

just a note to let you know I will be out of the office Wed(3/21) until 
Thurs(3/23).  The kids are on spring break.  I will be in San Marcos and you 
can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com.

I was planning on stopping by to see Hugo Elizondo on Thursday to drop off a 
check and give him the green light to file for replatting.  What will change 
if we want to try and complete the project in phases.  Does he need to change 
what he is going to submit to the city.

I spoke to Gordon Kohutek this morning.  He was contracted to complete the 
soils study.  He says he will be done with his report by the end of the 
week.  I don't know who needs this report.  I told Gordon you might call to 
inquire about what work he performed. His number is 512-930-5832.

We spoke on the phone about most of these issues.

Talk to you later.

Here is Larry Lewter's response to my request for more documentation to 
support the $15,000.  As you will read below, it is no longer an issue.  I 
think that was the last issue to resolve.

Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list
that I need further
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the
closing statement or on some other document.

Phillip

Please let me know if you want to go through it.  Also, please let me know if

In regards to your E-mail, I have recently been informed by Nicole that she 
will be leaving Enron effective April 30.  This is unfortunate because she 
has been a very valuable member of our team over the last few years and has 
been instrumental in developing the Eastern Rockies trading business and 
providing our customers with excellent service.  Nicole is not leaving to go 
to a competitor, but is going to spend more time with her family.  Given this 
fact, you probably want to speed up the transition. 

Call me and we can discuss.

Mark

		 Subject: Denver trading

I would like to welcome Susan Scott to the West Desk and specifically to the 
Eastern Rockies trading region.  The plan is for Susan to work with me in 
moving the day trading activities from the Denver office to Houston.  Her 
specific goals will be to take over activities performed by Nicole and 
Theresa while generating EOL products with me and in my absence.

Susan is currently learning how to use EOL and Sitara.  She is also working 
on understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different 
trading points from Opal to the mid-continent.

My plan is to have Susan go to the Denver office during May bid-week (April 
22 - April 24).  I want her to be sitting with Nicole and Theresa during 
bid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time.  I will 
probably want Nicole and Theresa to come to Houston one more time to sit with 
us and the logistics team, maybe in early May.  Then, Susan and I will both 
go to Denver in late May or early June to meet industry people and to 
complete the transfer of operations to the Houston office.

We can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding 
reservations.

Thank you,

Jay

Jacques,

Still trying to close the loop on the $15,000 of extensions.  Assuming that 
it is worked out today or tomorrow, I would like to get whatever documents 
need to be
completed to convey the partnership done.  I need to work with the engineer 
and architect to get things moving.  I am planning on  writing a personal 
check to the engineer while I am setting up new accounts.  Let me know if 
there is a reason I should not do this.

Thanks for all your help so far.  Between your connections and expertise in 
structuring the loan, you saved us from getting into a bad deal.

Larrry,

I realize you are disappointed about the project.  It is not my desire for 
you to be left with out of pocket expenses.  The only item from your list 
that I need further 
clarification is the $15,000 worth of extensions.  You mentioned that this 
was applied to the cost of the land and it actually represents your cash 
investment in the land.  I agree that you should be refunded any cash 
investment.  My only request is that you help me locate this amount on the 
closing statement or on some other document.

Jacques,

I think we reached an agreement with George and Larry to pick up the items of 
value and not pay any fees for their time.  It looks as if we will be able to 
use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, 
appraisal).  One point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in 
extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like 
earnest money would be applied.  I looked at the closing statements and I 
didn't see $15,000 applied against the purchase price.  Can you help clear 
this up.

Assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released.  
Keith and I are concerned about taking over the Bishop Corner partnership and 
the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities.  On the other hand, 
conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was 
clean.  What is your inclination?

Call as soon as you have a chance to review.

Lucy,

Here is the rentroll.

My only questions are about #18, #25, and #37 missed rent.  Any special 
reasons?

It looks like there are five vacancies #2,12,20a,35,40.  If you want to run 
an ad in the paper with a $50 discount that is fine.
I will write you a letter of recommendation.  When do you need it?  You can 
use me as a reference.  In the next two weeks we should really have a good 
idea whether the sale is going through.

Subject: Behind the Stage Two


FYI Western Price Survey Contacts

Cal-ISO's declaration of Stage Two alert this morning was triggered
in part by decision of Bonneville Power Administration to cease
hour-to-hour sales into California of between 600 MW and 1,000
MW that it had been making for the past week. According to BPA,
it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet
biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in
order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had
been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the
sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.

Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than
yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.
Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because
of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending
exchange energy into California, however.

More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the
Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.

Thanks for the information.  It would be helpful if you would send the 
detailed worksheet that you mentioned.

I am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones 
granted this January.  I have always elected to defer any distributions of 
restricted stock.  I believe I selected the minimum amount required to be 
kept in enron stock (50%).   Are you saying that all the previous grants have 
fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?

Thank you for looking into this issue.

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

?

Sincerely,

President

P.S.????? Copies of contracts will be forwarded upon acceptance of buyout.

Gentlemen,

Today I finally received some information on the status of the work done to 
date.  I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants.  The property is 
still in two parcels.  Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one  lot 
and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos.  He has also completed a 
topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to 
coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the 
smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going 
to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to 
complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which 
$14,000 are due now for work completed.  

We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by 
the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can 
continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's 
number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and 
ask him some questions.  I spoke to him about the possibility of your call 
and he was fine with that.  

Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp 
Flores can be used.

Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.  We left very 
optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project.

Call me with feedback after you speak to Hugo or with any other ideas about 
moving this project forward.

Jacques,

George finally sent me some information.  Please look over his email.  He 
wants us to buy him out.  Keith and I think this is a joke.  

We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to 
determine if it has any value going forward.  I don't believe the architect 
work will be of any use to us.  I don't think they deserve any compensation 
for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were 
proposing was unsupportable by the market.  

My version of a buyout is attached.

I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to 
foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?  
Since their cost
and fees didn't hold up versus the market and we didn't execute a contract, I 
wouldn't think they would stand a chance.  There isn't any time to waste so I 
want to respond to their offer asap.

Call me with your thoughts.

Phillip

Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout

Dear Phillip and Keith: 

We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash 
expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of 
all note obligations and design contracts.? 

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and 
existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, 
and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which 
current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.

Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this 
project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design 
and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of 
our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or 
rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? 

Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a 
percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on 
your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, 
or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the 
second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per 
year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these 
valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the 
forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in 
the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future 
projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per 
month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the 
attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings 
the total net buyout to $78,946.? 

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we 
offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout 
offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are 
prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? 
If this is your 



choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, 
Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then 
draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the 
Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout 
amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.

Thank you.

?

Sincerely,

President

P.S.????? Copies of contracts will be forwarded upon acceptance of buyout.

George,

I didn't receive the information on work completed or started.  Please send 
it this morning.  

We haven't discussed how to proceed with the land.  The easiest treatment 
would be just to deed it to us.  However, it might be more
advantageous to convey the partnership.

Also, I would like to speak to Hugo today.  I didn't find a Quattro 
Engineering in Buda.  Can you put me in contact with him.

Talk to you later.

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Lucy, 

Here is a rentroll for this week.  

What is the outstanding balance on #1.  It looks like 190 + 110(this week)= 
300.  I don't think we should make him pay late fees if can't communicate 
clearly.

#2 still owe deposit?

#9  What day will she pay and is she going to pay monthly or biweekly.

Have a good weekend.  I will talk to you next week.

In about two weeks we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy 
the property.  I will keep you informed.

Subject:  Sagewood Phase II


George,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the 
Sagewood
Phase II project.  Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the
project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a
number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward
on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a
Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted
pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are
acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about 
500+
units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, 
this,
we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious
effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested
loan amount to $8,868,000.

I have summarized our issues as follows:

1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:

     Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment
     Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR
     2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475
     3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417

2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit
turn over.

3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).

4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support
debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x 
debt
coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.

5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.

6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide
equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:

     Land -                   $1,121,670
     Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000
     Cash Equity              $1,419,268
     Total                    $2,955,938

7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage 
of
actual hard construction costs.

Darrell,

Today I let the builder/developer know that I would not proceed with his 
excessively high cost estimates.  As he did not have the funds to take on the 
land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me.  I would like 
to proceed and develop the property. 

 My thought is to compare the financing between Bank One and FHA.  I would 
also like to compare construction and development services between what you 
can do and a local builder in San Marcos that I have been speaking with.  
Making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to 
be in order.  I am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural 
work to date.  Once again the architect is Kipp Florres and the engineer is 
Quattro Consultants out of Buda.  Let me know if you have an opinion about 
either.

I look forward to working with you.  Talk to you tomorrow.

Daryl,

Here is the file that includes the proforma, unit costs, and comps.  This 
file was prepared by the builder/developer.


The architect that has begun to work on the project is Kipp Flores.  They are 
in Austin.

Thank you for your time this evening.  Your comments were very helpful.  I 
appreciate you and Greg taking a look at this project.

Al,

I was not going to do the MS this year.  Thanks for the offer though.

All is well here.  We went to Colorado last week and the kids learned to 
ski.  Work is same as always.
How are things going at New Power?  Is there any potential?

Did you put Frank Hayden up to this?  If this decision is up to me I would=

consider authorizing Mike G., Frank E., Keith H. and myself to trade west=

George,

I am back in the office and ready to focus on the project.  I still have
the concerns that I had last week.  Specifically that the costs of our
project are too high.  I have gathered more information that support my
concerns.  Based on my research, I believe the project should cost around
$10.5 million.  The components are as follows:

     Unit Cost, Site work, &
     builders profit($52/sf)             $7.6 million

     Land                      1.15

     Interim Financing               .85

     Common Areas                     .80

     Total                         $10.4

Since Reagan's last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, I am unable
to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs.

Also, the comps used in the appraisal from Austin appear to be class A
properties.  It seems unlikely that student housing in San Marcos can
produce the same rent or sales price.  There should adjustments for
location and the seasonal nature of student rental property.  I recognize
that Sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates
that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not
believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis.
Supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance.

After the real estate expert from Houston reviewed the proforma and cost
estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic.  He
feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8
million.  We would not even be able to cover the interim financing.

Keith and I have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that
we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5
million.   We would like to have a conference call Tuesday afternoon to 
discuss
alternatives.

Phillip

Don,

I was out last week.  Regarding the Montana supply, you can refer them to 
Mark Whitt in Denver.  

Let me know when you want to have the other meeting.

Also, we frequently give out quotes to mid-marketers on Fred LaGrasta's desk 
or Enron marketers in New York where the customer is EES.  I don't understand 
why your people don't contact the desk directly.

Are you planning to send today's bidweek deals soon? I just need to know

Lucy,

Here are few questions regarding the 2/16 rentroll:

#2  Has she actually paid the $150 deposit.  Her move in date was 2/6.  It is 
not on any rentroll that I can see.

#9  Explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she 
will start paying on #9

#15  Since he has been such a good tenant for so long.  Stop trying to 
collect the $95 in question.

#33  Missed rent.  Are they still there?

#26  I see that she paid a deposit.  But the file says she moved in on 1/30.  
Has she ever paid rent?  I can't find any on the last three deposits.

#44  Have the paid for February?  There is no payment since the beginning of 
the year.

#33  You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don't 
see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.  I need you to 
figure these out immediately.

I emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll 
in case you need to research these questions.

I will not be in the office next week.  If I can get connected you might be 
able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com.  Otherwise try and work with Gary 
on pressing issues.  If there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679.

George,

I can take a day off the week I get back from vacation.  Any day between 
March 5th-9th would work but Friday or Thursday would be my preference.

Regarding the differences in the two estimates, I don't want to waste your 
time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough.  The 
items I listed moved dramatically.  Also, some of the questions were just 
clarification of what was in a number.  

Let's try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow 
morning.

Subject: Sagewood II




Phillip -

George Richards asked that I drop you a line this morning to go over some
details on the San Marcos project.

1.  First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from
Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in
the transaction.

2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) 
will
be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the
acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma
performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit
officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer
signing off on the deal.

3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers
deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as
deferred profit has been acceptable.

Thanks,

Andrew Ozuna
Real Estate Loan Officer

There have been some updates to the cost.  The principal change is in the
addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will
costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs
have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than
sufficient, but there will be additional updates.

The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N
total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and
office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as
a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

The financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent
mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the
construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this
loan is obtained.

Based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the
construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land.

Phillip,

I spoke with AMF's broker today, and they will be satisfied with the deal if
we can get the school to agree to limit the current land use restrictions to
the terms that are in the existing agreement.  They do not want the school
to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet
with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the
subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF
wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today,
and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.

AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after
the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer,
and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the
details to Wayne McCoy.

I will be gone Thurs. and Fri. of this week.  I will be checking my
messages.

John,

Does next Thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies 
forecasts?  I will set up a room with Kim.

Here are some suggestions for projects for Colleen:

1.  Review and document systems and processes  -   The handoffs from ERMS, 
TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the 
       parties trying to make improvements.  I think I understand ERMS and 
TAGG but the issues facing 
       scheduling in Unify are grey.

2.  Review and audit complex deals- Under the "assume it is messed up" 
policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need 
further      scrutiny.

3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical 
imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?

4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training 
courses, review progress and make cuts.

5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.  Are we looking at 
everything we should?  Putting a person with a trading mentality should add 
   some value and direction to the group.


In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD 
to work part time to get it done.

The spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles.  Would you 
consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment 
and running a spinning video on the TV's.  I think the equipment would be 
used much more.  Members could just jump on a bike and follow the video any 
time of day.

Let me know if this is possible.

Jaques,

After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different 
definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a 
superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third 
party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of "construction management" 
fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be 
paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally 
the builders profit of 1.4 million.

Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out 
of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if 
they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  
We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition 
to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been 
in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and 
the superintendents are listed but I don't think the construction management 
fee is included.

George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will 
review and let you know what I think.

The GP issues don't seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to 
the 3 out 4 approval process.

Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only

Jeanie,

Lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into 
part time.  Nice confidentiality.  Since I have already gotten the grief, it 
would be nice to get some useful information.  What did you find out about 
part time, leave of absences, and sabbaticals?  My interest is for 2002.

Phillip:

Please excuse my oversight is not getting the proforma back to you in a 
usable format.? I did not realize that I had selected winmail.dat rather than 
sending it as an attachment.?? Then, I did not notice that I had overlooked 
your email until today. ??That spread sheet is attached and an updated 
proforma will go out to you this evening or tomorrow morning with a timeline.

Jeff,

Here is the application from SPB.  I guess they want to use the same form as 
a new loan application.  I have a call in to Lee O'Donnell to try to find out 
if there is a shorter form.  What do I need to be providing to the buyer 
according to the contract.  I was planning on bringing a copy of the survey 
and a rentroll including deposits on Monday.  Please let me know this morning 
what else I should be putting together.

Forward Reg Dickson's resume to Ted Bland for consideration for the trading 
track program.  He is overqualified and I'm sure too expensive to fill the 
scheduling position I have available.  I will work with Cournie Parker to 
evaluate the other resumes.

Lucy,

Thanks for clearing up the 2/2 file.  Moving on to 2/9, here are some 
questions:




#1 It looks like he just missed 1/26&2/9 of $110.  I can't tell if he still 
owes $47 on his deposit.

#13 I show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140.

#15 Try and follow up with Tomas about the $95.  Hopefully, he won't have a 
bad reaction.

#20b Missed rent?

#26  Has she paid any deposit or rent?

#27 Missed rent?

Lucy,

Here is the 2/2 rentroll.  The total does not equal the bank deposit.  Your 
earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35.

But the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to.  If the answer to 
this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and 
send it back.

Now I am going to work on a rentroll for this Friday.  I will probably send 
you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll.  Let's get this stuff clean today.

Lucy,

 Here is a rentroll for this week.  The one you sent for 11/24 looked good.  
It seems like most people are paying on time.  Did you rent an efficiency to 
the elderly woman on a fixed income?  Go ahead a use your judgement on the 
rent prices for the vacant units.  If you need to lower the rent by $10 or 
$20 to get things full, go ahead.

 I will be out of the office on Thursday.  I will talk to you on Friday.

Phillip

Colleen,

I checked the transport model and found the following extrinsic values on 
January 2nd versus February 11:

   1/2  2/11

Stanfield to Malin 209  81

SJ/Perm. to Socal 896  251

Sj to Socal  2747  768

PGE/Top to Citygate 51  3

PGE/Top to KRS 16  4

SJ to Valero  916  927


If these numbers are correct, then we haven't increased the extrinsic value 
since the beginning of the year.  Can you confirm that I am looking at the 
right numbers?

Phillip these are the volumes that AEC is considering selling at Opal over 
the next five years.  The structure they are looking for is a firm physical 
sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do 
this all with one party.  We are definitely being considered as that party.  
Given what we have seen in the marketplace they may be one of the few 
producers willing to sell long dated physical gas for size into Kern River.

What would be your bid for this gas?

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Lucy,

Here is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject 
to caps.  I wrote it as if it were from you.  It should come from the manager.

It is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there 
unit is when they move in.  This needs to be written in on their lease.

When you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize 
that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up.  

Have my Dad read the memo before you put it out.   You guys can make changes 
if you need to.





Next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and 
refrigerators.  We have to get this done next week.  I will email you a form 
to use to record serial numbers.  The prospective buyers want this 
information plus we need it for our records.  Something to look forward to.

It is 2 PM and I have to leave the office.  Please have my Dad call me with 
the information about the units at home 713-463-8626.  He will know what I 
mean.

Talk to you later,

I am sending the Dr. a contract for Monday delivery.  He is offering
$739,000 with $73,900 down.

He wants us to finish the work on the units that are being renovated now.
We need to specify those units in the contract.  We also need to specify the
units that have not been remodeled.  I think he will be a good buyer.  He is
a local with plenty of cash.  Call me after you get this message.

Lucy,

Here is the rentroll for this Friday.  Sorry it is so late.



There are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.

1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank 
is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the 
spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.

2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?

3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?

4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?

5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?

6.  #14  missed on 2/2?

7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?

8.  #20a missed on 2/2?

9.  #35 missed on 2/2?

My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  
You may have sent me a message over the "chat" line that I don't remember on 
some of these.  I just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the 
bank deposit.

Will have some time today to work on a utility letter.  Tried to call Wade 
last night at 5:30 but couldn't reach him.  Will try again today.

I believe that a doctor from Seguin is going to make an offer.  Did you meet 
them?  If so, what did you think?

Jacques,

Can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract?  

The key business points are:

1.  Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate

2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million

3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.

4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?

5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.

With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a 
solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes 
costs.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I 
would like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax 
all invoices within 48 hours.  We also would want online access to the 
checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing 
but invoices were not being submitted.

Let me know if you can draft these agreements.  The GP issue may need some 
tweaking.

Jeff,

My target is to get $225 back out of the stage.  Therefore, I could take a 
sales price of $740K and carry a second note of $210K.  This would still only 
require $75K cash from the buyer.  After broker fees and a title policy, I 
would net around $20K cash.  

You can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or 
higher with the terms described in the 1st email.  Do you want to give the 
New Braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.

Jeff,

I am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 
years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%.  There are several 
reasons that I won't commit to this.  Exposure to interest fluctuations, the 
large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer 
are the three biggest concerns.  

What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the 
buyers choice of terms up to 30 years.  The existing note does not come due 
until September 2009.  That is a long time.  The buyer may have sold the 
property.  Interest rates may be lower.  I am bending over backwards to make 
the deal work with such an attractive second note.  Guaranteeing to refinance 
is pushing too far.

Can you clarify the dates in the contract.  Is the effective date the day the 
earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete?

Hopefully the buyer can live with these terms.  I got your fax from the New 
Braunfels buyer.  If we can't come to terms with the first buyer I will get 
started on the list.

Email or call  me later today.

Susan,

Raised your issue to Sally Beck.  Larry is going to spend time with you to 
see if he can live without any reports.  Also some IT help should be on the 
way.

Subject: re: book admin for Pipe/Gas daily option book  

When we meet,  I would like to address the following issues:

1.)  I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have 
several people who have not left before 10:30 this week. 
2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on 
Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading 
floor until after 5:00 p.m.
3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and 
benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here 
late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One 
suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my 
understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get 
the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books 
like this and not lose good people.

Thanks

As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

Larry

Lucy,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the "Rent Due" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

Phillip

Got your email.  I will let Jacques know.  I guess we can work out the finer 
points next week.  The bank here in Houston is dealing with their auditors 
this week, so unfortunately I did not hear from them this week.  The are 
promising to have some feedback by Monday.  I will let you know as soon as I 
hear from them.

George,

The probability of building a house this year is increasing.  I have shifted 
to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could 
not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more 
towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One 
wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 
kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage + 
guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This 
plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the 
courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor 
living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. 
 The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass 
skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have 
single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.  

I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.  I would 
like to come and visit you again this month.  If it would work for you, I 
would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm.  I 
would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we 
didn't have time for.  I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. 

Call or email to let me know if this would work for you.  
pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)

Jeff,

Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.

1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and 
repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor 
cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on 
repairs.

2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite 
manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has 
interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager 
that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a 
management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager 
onsite.

3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you 
want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.

4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure 
this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.

My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property 
definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.


Sales Price  705,000

1st Lien   473,500

2nd Lien  225,000

Transfer fee    7,500

Cash required   14,500


NOI   100,000

1st Lien    47,292

2nd Lien   23,694

Cash flow  29,014

Cash on cash  200%


These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then 
cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the 
additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years 
for a higher price.

Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

Phillip

=09=09 Subject: CPUC Audit Report on Edison

The following are the highlights from the Executive Summary of the KPMG aud=
it=20
report on Southern California Edison:
=20
I. Cash Needs
Highlights:
SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=
plete=20
cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20
program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=
s=20
and other measures.=20
Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20
available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=
.8=20
million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20
conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.
II. Credit Relationships
Highlights:
SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20
extend or renew credit as it has become due.
At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.
SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=
lt.=20
Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=
nd=20
payable.
SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=
=20
indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20
indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.
Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =
its=20
rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=
=20
issues within the last three weeks.
III. Energy Cost Scenarios
Highlights
This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20
various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=
 such=20
scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.
IV. Cost Containment Initiatives
Highlights
SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.
The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=
=20
improvement component as follows (in millions):
Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77
Capital Improvement Costs                383
Total                                             $ 460
The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=
=20
be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=
om=20
contract employees.
Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=
=20
most part being deferred to a future date.
SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20
executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20
savings of approximately $92 million.
V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20
Activity)
Highlights:
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20
Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20
includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20
million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.
As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=
=20
Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.
Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=
e=20
end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=
=20
balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20
D.01-01-018.
Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20
generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20
tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20
expressed in the TRA, are overstated.
TURN Proposal
As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=
RN=20
to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=
s.=20
Our comments are summarized as follows:
The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=
t=20
would not directly generate nor use cash.
The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=
ift=20
costs between two regulatory assets.
TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=
 the=20
revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =
in=20
the TRA is overstated.
VI. Flow of Funds Analysis
Highlights:
In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=
=20
positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.
During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=
=20
its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.
Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=
=20
shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=
on=20
stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=
ve=20
and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.
[there is no Section VII]
=20
VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates
SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=
=20
million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20
In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=
=20
This increase correlates to the increase in market prices
for natural gas for the same period.
A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20
www.cpuc.ca.gov.

George,

In response to your ideas

Time and cost

1.  I realize that asking for a fixed price contract would result in the

Jeff,

That is good news about Leander.  

Now for the stage.  I would like to get it sold by the end of March.   I have 
about $225K invested in the stagecoach, 
 it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven.  

I don't need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee 
and Jaques Craig can 
work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a 
second lien.  I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.
Checkout this spreadsheet.





These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes.   
However,  I am very concerned about the way it is being shown.  Having Lucy 
show it is not a good idea.  I need you to meet the buyers and take some 
trips over to get more familar with the property.  My dad doesn't have the 
time and I don't trust 
Lucy or Wade to show it correctly.  I would prefer for you to show it from 
now on.  

I will have the operating statements complete through December by this 
Friday. 


Phillip

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626


Phillip

I was wondering if I could trouble you again for another guest id for eol.
In previous months, it has helped us here at NGI when we go to set indexes.

Phillip:

It looks like a deal with the non gas fired QFs is iminent.  One for the gas 
generators is still quite a ways off.  

The non gas fired QFs will be getting a fixed price for 5 years and reverting 
back to their contracts thereafter.  They also will give back 

I would expect that the gas deal using an implied gas price times a heat rate 
would be very very difficult to close.  Don't expect hedgers to come any time 
soon.

I will keep you abreast of developments.

Subject: Status of QF negotiations on QFs & Legislative Update

This from a conference call with IEP tonight at 5 pm:

RE;  Non-Gas-fired QFs -- The last e-mail I sent includes the latest version 
of the IEP proposal.  Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially 
complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with 
the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would "retain" $106 million (of 
what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who 
switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the 
QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December 
(and maybe earlier).

PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the 
Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get 
some assurances of payment. 

SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due 
on 2/2/01.

For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's 
purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements 
(Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be 
resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this 
occurred today.

Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will 
happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.  
Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is 
dead. Republicans were very much opposed to it.

George,

 I received the drawings.  They look good at first glance.  I will look at 
them in depth this weekend.  The proforma was in the winmail.dat format which 
I cannot open.  Please resend in excel or a pdf format.  If you will send it 
to pallen70@hotmail.com, I will be able to look at it this weekend.  Does 
this file have a timeline for the investment dollars?  I just want to get a 
feel for when you will start needing money.

This sounds like an opportunity to land a couple of analyst to fill the gaps 
in scheduling.  Remember their rotations last for one year.  Do you want to 
be an interviewer?

Subject: Analyst Interviews Needed - 2/15/01


	

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

There is a specific program that we are using to recruit, train, and mentor 
new traders on the gas and power desks.    The trading track program is being 
coordinated by Ted Bland.  I have forwarded him your resume.  Give him a call 
and he will fill you in on the details of the program.

Lucy,

#32 and #29 are fine.  

#28 paid weekly on 1/5.  Then he switched to biweekly.  He should have paid 
260 on 1/12.  Two weeks rent in advance.  Instead he paid 260 on 1/19.  He 
either needs to get back on schedule or let him know he is paying in the 
middle of his two weeks.  He is only paid one week in advance.  This is not a 
big deal, but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance.

Here is an updated rentroll.  Please use this one instead of the one I sent 
you this morning.

Finally, can you fax me the application and lease from #9.

Larry,

I met with a banker that is interested in financing the project.  They need 
the following:

Financial statements plus last two years tax returns.
Builders resume listing similar projects

The banker indicated he could pull together a proposal by Friday.  If we are 
interested in his loan, he would want to  come see the site.
If you want to overnight me the documents, I will pass them along.   You can 
send them to my home or office (1400 Smith, EB3210B, Houston, TX 77002).

The broker is Jim Murnan.  His number is 713-781-5810, if you want to call 
him and send the documents to him directly.

It sounds like the attorneys are drafting the framework of the partnership 
agreement.  I would like to nail down the outstanding business points as soon 
as possible.  

Please email or call with  an update.

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number. 

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the 
forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a 
supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. 

"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward," said William Burson, 
a trader. "It makes the market for natural gas." 

But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas 
Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the 
storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the 
numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than 
reality. 

"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what 
we are reporting," McGill said. 

As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- 
and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing 
fingers at Wall Street. 

Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently 
stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for 
the rise in gas prices. 

"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated," Adik 
told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. 

In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric 
utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. 

Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame 
for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their 
customers and constituents from such price spikes. 

Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take 
precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price 
insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas 
prices before they soared. 

"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over," said Paul 
Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. 

But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. 

"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to 
change," said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security 
Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. 


Hot topic 

Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In 
many circles, little else is discussed. 

The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is 
facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the 
previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as 
well. 

The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of 
his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial 
pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. 

"It's the talk of the town here," he said. 

A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per 
thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile 
to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by 
customers. 

But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand 
cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage 
for winter. 

There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, 
prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information 
Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating 
bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. 

But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, 
including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas 
markets. 

"It's all about the weather," said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. 

Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York 
traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile 
commodity in the world. 


Setting the price 

In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of 
gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading 
contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had 
widespread influence over gas prices. 

The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon 
as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale 
prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from 
utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what 
they pay for the gas they expect to use. 

There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention 
of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge 
of natural gas. 

But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to 
know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all 
futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to 
their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money 
in a short time. 

As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less 
than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. 
Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's 
weekly storage numbers. 

Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to 
need in the winter. 

Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than 
average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in 
hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. 

Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be 
sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the 
concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. 

Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage 
numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the 
association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. 

But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice 
president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had 
continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. 

"I was getting worried," he said. 

Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer. 
Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices 
dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. 


Just passing through 

Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but 
pass their fuel costs on to customers. 

Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas 
charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas 
Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. 

Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last 
month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could 
be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve 
energy. 

Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to 
save an average customer about $25 this winter. 

Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an 
extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not 
guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. 

Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left 
customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether 
they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel 
costs. 

On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public 
Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to 
perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices. 

"Consumers are taking all the risk," Micheel said. "It's time to consider 
some changes."

Lucy,

Why did so many tenants not pay this week?

#12 95
#21 240
#27 120
#28 260
#33 260

Total 975

It seems these apartments just missed rent.  What is up?

Other questions:

#9-Why didn't they pay anything?  By my records, they still owe $40 plus rent 
should have been due on 12/12 of $220.

#3-Why did they short pay?

Enron has agreed that the key issue is to focus on solving the S-T buying 
needs.  Attached is a spreadsheet that outlines the $ magnitude of the next 
few months.

TALKING POINTS:

Lot's of questions about DWR becoming the  vehicle for S-T buying and there 
is a significant legal risk for it becoming the vehicle.  WE DO NEED 
SOMETHING TO BRIDGE BEFORE WE PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS.
Huge and growing shortfall ($3.2B through March 31, 2001) 
The SOONER YOU CAN PUT IN L-T CONTRACTS STOP THE BLEEDING.
Bankruptcy takes all authority out of the Legislature's hands.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Energy Sales Participation Agreement During Bankruptcy

Michael Tribolet will be contacting John Klauberg to discuss how to organize 
a Participation Agreement to sell to UDCs in Bankruptcy while securing Super 
Priority.

2. Legislative Language for CDWR (?) Buying Short-Term

Sandi McCubbin / Jeff Dasovich will lead team to offer new language to meet 
S-T requirements of UDCs.  Key is to talk with State of California Treasurer 
to see if the $ can be found or provided to private firms.  ($3.5B by end of 
April).  Pat Boylston will develop "public benefit" language for options 
working with Mike Day.  He can be reached at 503-294-9116 or 
pgboylston@stoel.com.

3. Get Team to Sacramento

Get with Hertzberg to discuss the options (Bev Hansen).  Explain the 
magnitude of the problem.  Get Mike Day to help draft language.  

4. See if UDCs have any Thoughts

Steve Kean will communicate with UDCs to see if they have any solutions or 
thougths.  Probably of limited value.

5. Update List

Any new information on this should be communicated to the following people as 
soon as possible.  These people should update their respective business units.

Enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser.  Note that the
construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our
standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio
of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.

Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs
are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have
actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf
without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.

It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly
sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.

I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are
$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3
bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached
garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.

Larry,

Do you want the loan and wire amount to be for exactly $1.1 million.

George,

Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders 
profit.  Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be 
recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would 
be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.



Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the 
investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned 
earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as 
part of the construction contract.  

Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look 
like here are a few ideas:

 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from 
higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.

 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 
1 complete in November)
      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule
      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule

This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but 
could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule 
must be discussed and agreed upon.

Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626


Phillip

Lucy,

Here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages.  There 
are alot of overages.  It will probably get worse this month because of all 
the cold weather.

You need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap.  
This needs to be handwritten on all new leases.

I am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet.  We 
also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need 
to conserve energy if they don't want to exceed their cap.  I will write 
something today.



Wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start 
collecting.

Frank,

Did you receive the information about the San Marcos apartments.  I have left 
several messages at your office to follow up.  You mentioned that your plate 
was fairly full.  Are you too busy to look at this project?  As I mentioned I 
would be interested in speaking to you as an advisor or at least a sounding 
board for the key issues.  

Please email or call.

Questions about 12/29 rentroll:

 There were two deposits that were not labeled.  One for $150 and the other 
for $75.  Which apartments?  20a or #13?

 Utility overages for #26 and #44?  Where did you get these amounts?  For 
what periods?

 
What is going on with #42.   Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!!  
That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money 
and time remodeling.  I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first 
asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like 
leaky pipes.  If that doesn't work, we should tell them we will clean the 
apartment and charge them for the labor.  Then we will perform monthly 
inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property.  This tenant has 
been here since September 1998, I don't want to run them off.

I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so 
I couldn't check the total from the rentroll against the bank.  Is this 
right?  Has the deposit been made yet?


 A rentroll for Jan 5th will follow shortly.

Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

I view my bonus as partly attributable to my own trading and partly to the 
group's performance.  Here are my thoughts.

Cash  2 MM   4 MM   6 MM

Here are Mike's numbers.  I have not made any adjustments to them.

point.

Gentlemen,

 I continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure 
and a mortgage broker for help with the financing.  Regarding the financing, 
I am working with Jim Murnan at Pinnacle Mortgage here in Houston.  I have 
sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information 
on you.  Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone 
(713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net.

 I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I 
hope to pull that together this afternoon.

 I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He 
was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the 
bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss 
these procedures in advance.

 Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.

Jim,

 I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I 
described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in 
San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a 
couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like 
to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not 
require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to 
structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has 
been mentioned is to obtain a "forward commitment" in order to reduce the 
equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this 
nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to 
permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be 
important to banks. 

 I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer 
email or fax his financial statement to you.

 Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.

Jeff,

Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I 
have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out 
tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility 
connections?  Other rezoning costs?  

What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I 
owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this 
property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes 
once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him 
grazing rights?

What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and 
annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and 
American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we 
are pushing the process as fast as we can.

Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.

George & Larry,


 If possible,  I would like to get together in Columbus as Larry suggested.  
Thursday afternoon is the only day that really works for me.  
Let me know if that would work for you.  I was thinking around 2  or 2:30 pm.

I will try to email you any questions I have from the latest proforma

Lucy,

 I want to get the lease data and tenant data updated.  
  
  The critical information is  1.  Move in or lease start date
      2.  Lease expiration date
      3.  Rent
      4.  Deposit 
  
  If you have the info you can
  fill in these items  1.  Number of occupants
      2.  Workplace
      

  All the new leases should be the long form.



 The apartments that have new tenants since these columns have been updated 
back in October are  #3,5,9,11,12,17,21,22,23,25,28,33,38.
  

 I really need to get this by tomorrow.  Please use the rentroll_1215 file to 
input the correct information on all these tenants.  And email it to me 
tomorrow.  You should have all this information on their leases and 
applications.

Lucy,

Here is a new file for 12/15.




For the rentroll for 12/08 here are my questions:

 #23 & #24 did not pay.  Just late or moving?

 #25 & #33 Both paid 130 on 12/01 and $0 on 12/08.  What is the deal?

 #11  Looks like she is caught up.  When is she due again?


Please email the answers.

Phillip

Subject: Re:  

Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the "socalprices" spread sheet 
supposed to be in $?  If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where 
did they come from?  I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.

As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter.  We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today.  It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the 
whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.

Thanks.

As noted in my  last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had 
the incorrect start date.  My last report showed an online date of May 2001; 
the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
access to in the WSCC:

 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan

If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.

Dave,

The back office is having a hard time dealing with the $11 million dollars 
that is to be recognized as transport expense by the west desk then recouped 
from the Office of the Chairman.    Is your understanding that the West desk 
will receive origination each month based on the schedule below.

 
 The Office of the Chairman agrees to grant origination to the Denver desk as 
follows:

October 2000  $1,395,000
November 2000 $1,350,000
December 2000 $1,395,000
January 2001  $   669,600
February 2001  $   604,800
March 2001  $   669,600
April 2001  $   648,000
May 2001  $   669,600
June 2001  $   648,000
July 2001  $   669,600
August 2001  $   669,600
September 2001 $   648,000
October 2001  $   669,600
November 2001 $   648,000
December 2001 $   669,600

This schedule represents a demand charge payable to NBP Energy Pipelines by 
the Denver desk.  The demand charge is $.18/MMBtu on 250,000 MMBtu/Day 
(Oct-00 thru Dec-00) and 120,000 MMBtu/Day (Jan-01 thru Dec-01).  The ENA 
Office of the Chairman has agreed to reimburse the west desk for this expense.

Let me know if you disagree.

Phillip,

It looks as though we have most of the interim hardware upgrades in the 
building now, although we are still expecting a couple of components to 
arrive on Monday.

The Unix Team / DBA Team and Applications team expect to have a working test 
server environment on Tuesday. If anything changes, I'll let you know.

best regards

We linked the file you sent us to telerate and we replace >40000 equals $250 
to a 41.67 heat rate.  We applied forward gas prices to historical loads.  I 
guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year.  
Prices seem low.  Looks like November NP15 is trading above the cap based on 
Nov 99 loads and current gas prices.  What about a forecast for this November 
loads.

Let me know what you think.

George,

 The San Marcos project is sounding very attractive.  I have one other 
investor in addition to Keith that has interest.  Some additional background 
information on Larry and yourself would be helpful.

 Background Questions:
 
 Please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in 
Creekside.

 Please list projects completed during the last 5 years.  Include the project 
description, investors, business entity, 

 Please provide the names and numbers of prior investors.

 Please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on 
recent projects.


 With regard to the proposed investment structure, I would suggest a couple 
of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between Creekside and the 
investors. 


 Preferable Investment Structure:

 Developers guarantee note, not investors.

 Preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing.

 Builder assumes some risk for cost overruns.

         Since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should 
tackle these issues now.  These questions are not intended to be offensive in 
any way.  It is my desire to build a successful project with Creekside that 
leads to future opportunities.  I  am happy to provide you with any 
information that you need to evaluate myself or Keith as a business partner.

Sincerely,

Phillip Allen

Bob,

 Patti Sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while Randy 
Gay was on a personal leave.  She displayed a tremendous amount of commitment 
to the west desk during that time.  She frequently came to work before 4 AM 
to prepare operations reports.  Patti worked 7 days a week during this time.  
If long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this 
time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on Patti.  
She didn't crack and provided much needed info during this time.

 Patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. 
specialist.  Based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a PBR.  Let me know 
what is an acceptable cash amount.

Subject: Investment Structure


STRUCTURE:
Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)
general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the
liability of construction.

LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS
The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and
any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in
the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and
all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the
loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means
that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits
is reduced.

All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are
full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,
the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be
non-recourse.

USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT
The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &
architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for
organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike
many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to
Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over
the estimated 6 month design and approval period.

EARLY LAND COSTS
The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost
represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of
extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at
probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase
price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated
monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus
approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.

EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN
Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require
the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as
the "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of
improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the
improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be
for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after
completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should
expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot
improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an
irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a
development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not
spent no interest is charged on these funds.

The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a
finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as
high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000
per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at
$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000
which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to
obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement
provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the
improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would
cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds
spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the
preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a
tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can
significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.

Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total
lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably
$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The
improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design
costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and
landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for
undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would
estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the
loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give
you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required
of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing
is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the
separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility
standpoint.

CONSTRUCTION LOANS
There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative
(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is
a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the
builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction
loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to
start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans
in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any
construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too
difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.

Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for
pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will
be from 80% to 95% of value.

DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and
near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority
payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner
will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the
fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to
15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.
These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to
calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership
expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has
to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or
cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this
function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain
from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.
Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is
used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own
any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track
to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.

REPORTING
We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.
What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based
reporting.

BOOKKEEPING
I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, "Bookkeeping
procedures to record actual expenses?"  Please expand.

INVESTOR INPUT
We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always
the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my
experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume
Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every
effort to be accommodating.

CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES
CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as
formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market
obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional
subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,
for vendors they are constantly shopped.

PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS
Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can
provide these if you are interested.

I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call
when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Sincerely,

George Richards
President, Creekside Builders, LLC

Bob,

 Regarding Patti Sullivan's contributions to the west desk this year, her 
efforts deserve recognition and a PBR award.  Patti stepped up to fill the 
gap left by Randy Gay's personal leave.  Patti held together the scheduling 
group for about 2 month's by working 7days a week during this time.  Patti 
was always the first one in the office during this time.  Frequently, she 
would be at work before 4 AM to prepare the daily operation package.  All the 
traders came to depend on the information Patti provided.   This information 
has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size 
of the west desk positions.  
 Please call to discuss cash award.

Lucy,

       Here are the actual utility bills versus the cap.  Did we collect 
these overages?  Let's discuss further?  Remember these bills were paid in 
July and August.  The usage dates are much earlier.  I have the bills but I 
can get them to you if need be.

Bob,

 Any time tomorrow between 10 am and 1 pm would be good for looking at the 
plans.  As far as the TV's, what do you need me to do?  Do we need plasma 
screens or would regular monitors be just as good at a fraction of the cost.

Team, 

Attached is the newest EBS orgchart, updated 2 days ago.  They have made some 
interesting changes.


Also, you can click on the URL below to go to the EBS intranet site, where 
you will find all sorts of information related to EBS, its market and 
competition, etc.  As a "high-tech" company, they actually do keep this 
updated very frequently, unlike some of the other Enron internal web sites.

(you will find Norm Levine's market/comp info here, as well)

Kim,

I would like to either meet with you, or trade e-mails on your current and 
possible future target accounts list where GSS may be able to add value to 
your efforts.  Since we're ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, I 
want to make sure I'm not holding resource open on any accounts which may 
not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team 
have requested our involvement with.  I also want to make sure I'm bringing 
resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.

For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent 
developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received 
from the NYC office re:  Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, 
where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be 
with one of their medical groups based in Chicago.  After several 
unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant 
category.  Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagement 
with your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, and 
today American Express has surfaced.  Consequently, I think it's probably a 
good idea for me to make sure I'm focused on the right accounts for you.  

I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would 
work?  If not, I would have Monday the 18th available late afternoon, or any 
time on December 27th, 28th, or 29th.  When would be good for you?  Please 
let me know!

Thank you,

Jeff

I want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, 
Tom).  I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past.   It's an 
issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are 
okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone.  
Thanks for your help,

Thanks for the inquiry.  I sincerely appreciate you giving me the heads up.  
As much as it pains me to say yes, I think John has proved himself worthy and 
I am willing to let him interview for the job.  As we talked about before, my 
only condition is that you guys make sure you are willing to take him if he 
comes out on top.  If there is any chance that his past will negatively 
influence your decision, I am not willing to let him interview.  He handled 
the last experience with real maturity, but I do not want him to have any 
more reasons to doubt his ability to overcome his past by working hard and 
proving himself here.  He is very valuable to me and ENA.  Please let me 
know.

Well, never got to NY to enjoy New Years and the blizzard.? However, by 
staying in Dallas, did experience a white New Year's eve.? Never made it to 
Addison Cafe for New Year's eve dinner (back up plans), roads were just too 
bad.? But I cooked fresh salmon at home and we had a very lovely dinner. 

Hope you had a wonderful celebration (not quite the same as last year in 
Sidney, now was it) and brought in the new year with a bang!

Have a happy, healthy and much more prosperous 2001!? I wish only the best 
for you.? Love you much, your Mom

Is there a man by the name of Henry (Dutch) Quigley who will be working in 
your group?  His name was not on the list I sent to you previously,
but he showed up on another list from HR as being assigned to your group.  
Please let me know and I will make any necessary adjustments

Subject: Site Location Advisory Service




I am pleased to inform you that one of Canada's leading business service
providers, Grant Thornton LLP, is now offering US firms a full Site Location
Advisory Service.

With over forty offices across Canada, Grant Thornton LLP knows Canada.  We

such as yours.

Grant Thornton LLP would be pleased to discuss this service with you.  It is
a full service that includes, on your behalf, real estate sourcing, labor
force analysis and verification, tax analysis and comparison, and incentive
negotiations.

Should you be considering expanding your operations and interested in
discussing our service, please give us a call.  More and more United States
firms, from call centers to manufacturers are locating in Canada to serve
both their US and Canadian customers.

Jennifer, 

This is apparently the type of deal flip-flop which BMC has been blessing EBS 
with.  In the note from Doug Cummins which contained his updated spend 
projections, he had the "Professional Services" highlighted with a bunch of 
question marks.  It is at the bottom of his sheet, and lists a qty of 30 @ 
$2000 per = $60,000 --- I assume that's $2K/hour or per day.  Either way, 
it's not something that appears palatable to them (Net Works).  I'll be going 
over there in a few minutes, and will try to check w/each of the guys.  I'll 
keep you posted.

Jeff

Clarification on the below.

Point #1 our position has been $3MM on software (they are saying they need 
$4MM to get the deal done.)

Additionally, they want Maintenance and professional services to go with the 
dollar amount.  $2.4MM is their position here.  I need your help to clarify 
with each group who is on board with maintenance and profesional services.  
BMC's #2 guy Jeff Hawn told Jim Crowder this was critical for them.

Thanks,

Steve

Jeff,

Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal.  We are making real progress.  
Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  
$4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services
2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  
No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 
3.  Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving 
purchase commitment from Enron?  
Not sure what you mean here
4.  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be 
done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?
We prefer the 14th, but if we can't get it until the 15th, that will work


Please let me know if you have any other questions.  I will call you tomorrow 
to touch base.

Thanks,

		 Subject: BMC Update

Steve/Chaz - 

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point.  

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc.  In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the 
"accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Your 
note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

I will call you to follow up on this note.

Thank you,

Jeff Youngflesh

Subject: Re: NG YEAR ENd Quiz  

I belong to a natgas discussion group on the internet. This is from one of 
the guys. Basically they are a bunch of gastraders from various firms ( a lot 
of producers, some industrials, some small shops and few i--banker types) I 
found the test to be mildly amusing. And since I had no idea what 'club no 
minors' was-- i was hoping for some insight from you guys. Fortunately, the 
lovely Ms. Shipos was able to fill me in.

Anyway, while occasionally garbage, the discussions do provide insight on 
what others are thinking of production, storage and other such matters. And 
when I was a marketer, I found a few leads. Finally, since a lot of the 
information revolves around gossip about a particular 'super trader' at the 
big ENE , i find it amusing that one of the most reserved and modest 
individuals I know is so talked about on the internet.

Subject: fund views

Hi- all the funds are trying to figure out what the play is for next year- 
major divergence of opinions.  Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.

+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the 
perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no 
industrial (basic industry type) can operate.  He tracks all the plant 
closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a 
more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track 
this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic 
conditions- like recession!!).  I will try to find out what his total number 
for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does 
not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for 
the summer.

While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levels
He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) 
based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally 
think that 1Q02 sees little.  I know that the fundamentals group is tracking 
these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q 
over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.

He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, 
crude/propane....

+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 
storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the 
backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower 
baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.  I am torn 
on this one.

+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same 
analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long 
nat gas!! through vol or outright.

+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas 
just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM 
issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. 

+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: 
Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance 
(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, 
I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.

Have a great holiday!  I'll be here next week.

Caroline

Hey:
Sorry I didn't get to come by before I left. I have been in London since 
12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday 
season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron)
 Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I 
suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, 
Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he 
should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. 
Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a 
large role in turning the crude and products group around. 

 Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of 
good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the 
gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products 
(especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I 
think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together.

Happy New Year!
Jen

Stewart,

Per our phone conversation, Universal is looking for sponsorship funds to 
grow JPI (Jurassic Park Institute).

Enron Media has an opportunity (perhaps) to provide advertising risk 
management services beyond their Motion Picture Group, to their Music, Home 
Video and Recreation Groups.

There may be an opportunity for EBS to provide bandwidth in lieu of 
sponsorship dollars or some other type of arrangement.

I am trying to reschedule my meeting with their motion picture advertising 
team for the second week in January, so I'll stay in touch to see if you 
develop an opportunity through their global sourcing group.

Regards,

the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just 
not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of 
demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we 
gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground 
and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, 
distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.
good holidays,
john

Plants Shut Down and Sell the Energy
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at its
giant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from the
Bonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a better
deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting
unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is
selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it
pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.
It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in
energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even
oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or
natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large
industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --
will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they
also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum
and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to
consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.
"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't know
what they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chief
economist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increased
their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills on
an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated
that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a
typical U.S. household.
That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher
energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected
growth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annual
rate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energy
price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic
slowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in
Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use
natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the
company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in
December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,
which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its
existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative
officer.
"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.
Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but
Rosenbury said it would be "substantial."  In coming months, Terra's good
fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the
prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even
point. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate
the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"
Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."
He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18
million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operating
now. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible that
farmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark
Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and
distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,
indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next
month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify
continued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble
[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able to
buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said Paul
M. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. A
continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and
raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions to
plant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."
According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas
remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --
farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the
aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the
industry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, an
analyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.
Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,
and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get more
production cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. and
world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum
supplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then
[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more
than the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open question
how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually
entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,
says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville
for $550 a megawatt hour for December.
But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future
profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,
to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to
Bonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and
Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after
next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries
to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Out
here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an
ethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they live
up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Mosey
said.

Any idea what amount of switching in gas equivalents does the implied demand

See note on switching. It is hard to monitor the distiallte because any 
switching is being absorbed by the incessant arrival of European cargoes. We 
hope to have you guys some better numbers before the end of the week.

PIRA report attached - bit uninspired this week, like the stats.

Crude went back to the usual pattern and built 2 .4 mbbls, as opposed to an 
implied draw (excl SPR) of 2 (although half of this in PADD 5). Perhaps 
surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and 
gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. 
Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 
kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold 
weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well 
above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur 
material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. 
However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.
Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not 
the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? 
Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. 
Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.
Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly 
high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.

John,
As we discussed earlier, ENA HR is working with the A/A program to develop a 
process for placing sr. spec into associate titles.  Unfortunately, that 
process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.  
Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to 
interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.  

Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in 
similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to 
be held the first week of Jan.  I would like to handle all of these 
consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this 
discussion.  I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until 
after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.

Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the 
title change.  Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest 
convenience.  If you need my assistance with this please let me know.   I 
apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.  Please 
contact me with any questions/concerns.

Jennifer,
I just spoke with Lee Jackson, Enron Plastics and Petrochemicals, in regard 
to Universal Studios.  He did not feel Universal's plastic spend would be in 
the range their group would consider for a prospect.  Lee said their main 
clients are chemical companies/producers.  He mentioned a typical usage would 
be 1 Billion Lbs/yr in polymers and  5-10 MM Lbs/year in polymers large 
users.  

I also briefly mentioned EP&P possibly coming to do an overview training for 
us.  I mentioned this to Sarah-Joy and she said she would schedule something 
through Alan Engberg beginning next year.

Sarah-Joy...
I just picked up your voice mail...

I am forwarding Byron Gaddis's e-mail in response to your question of who
PCC is working with at EES.

Let me stress that I am not working with anyone other than John (and now
hopefully you) at Enron to get PCC Ball Valves approved for international
use at Enron.

I am providing Byron Gaddis' e-mail address as he is in Portland at Corp HQ=
,
and is familiar with the issue. He may be able to provide a name for you at
EES that PCC is working to conclude an agreement on energy....note that the
activity is covered under a Conf Agreement to protect PCC and its data. In
addition, Byron was curious about your possible need for blades and the
mechanism you go through to acquire them.

As for me... we would like you to fall in love with our world class ball
valves from PCC Ball Valves (hence putting them on the approved supplier
list) AND also love our Emergency Shutdown Systems for pipelines by our
Barber Industries (again, feeling so smitten that they find their way onto
your approved list)... John has the information packages on both companies
and product lines...

For me... signing off from Milan Italy...where I have been living and
breathing these ball valves this week. Shipments of 40" and 48" units going
to Transgaz on a Romanian/ Russian pipeline as well as 36" units for a
Turkish pipeline are going out....

As of today, Richard Roberts, FedEx Senior Attorney, notified me of the
following:

Billy Mike Golden, Managing Director of Field Facility Management,
received a call from John Patillo.  Mr. Golden was in the process of
returning his call at approximately 2:15 p.m.    Depending on what the
two discussed will determine if FedEx needs to hold a conference call to
discuss this further.

If a conference call is needed, it will occur as soon as possible.  The
attendees will be FedEx employees.  They are as follows:

Carmen Perez, Corporate Account Executive
Billy M. Golden
Gary Stoops, Managing Director of Supply Chain Management
Richard Roberts

After FedEx holds the conference call, it will be determined if FedEx
commercial and legal needs to meet with Enron commercial and legal.

I understand if resolution does not take place prior to December 31,
2000 FedEx may not be Enron's carrier.

Regards,

Carmen Perez

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for hosting a brown bag lunch session yesterday; your presentation 
was very informative and I believe it led to greater understanding of 
Business Development within GSS.  On a personal level, I was very interested 
in your Continental deal and would like to read a white paper or postmortems 
analysis of the deal after it closes.

I also thank you for taking an active role in this mornings' brown bag, I 
felt like it lent additional credibility to Experience Enron and answered the 
inevitable "what's in it for me" questions.

Sincerely,
Jim WiningerMessage-ID: <12092769.1075849626808.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Jennifer,

I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one.  I 
did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to 
Jenny and Bob McAuliffe.  When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's 
retraction.  It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very 
"customer-focused" on BMC's part.  I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to 
the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!

Not that it matters but wanted you to know:
BMC rep left message recanting the fact that we would still have the 45 % 
discount if SAP modules were purchased at some other time.  He states now 
that if not purchased now the discount would only be 10-20 % range at a later 
date.

Subject: BMC DEAL 
Importance: High

Jenny/Bob

Per the BMC deal, here is where we are with Batch Processing:

TidalSoft, Sysadmiral
Approx.  90 k  ( current quote covers us and GPG and does not include SAP ) 
We have added a couple of pieces to this and it could bring the cost to 125 k 
worst case.  This quote covers consulting and maintenance.  They are trying 
very hard to get a deal done this year  and we could probably get our 
additional components at the current quote price if we signed.  

BMC, Control -M
Approx. 325 k   This is after we remove the SAP modules and components from 
the quote. Quote that was sent over from Jeff Youngflesh (Enron GSS) was for 
a total of 628 k

Hardware for either product is approx. 300 k. 

We have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to take 
over their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our long 
term strategy. They actually do not recommend either of these product's SAP 
modules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectors 
into BMC.  We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft 
(Larry if you have info on this please comment).

Larry's and his team have eval'd both products and although they are leaning 
towards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable.  You 
guys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight it 
will lend to the EBS/BMC deal.  FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45% 
discount if we cut the SAP modules.  BMC needs to sit down with PB and learn 
how over priced their products are !

Let me know what you think.  If we go TidalSoft I need to push this through 
or be advised to let it go till the New Year.

Thanks
Bruce


*****
Also in Quote sent over from Youngflesh :
BMC, Control SA
1.3 M     NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME  - Is a candidate for future 
consideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculate 
as to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS.   I guess they put 
this quote together from info they received from Henry Moreno

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Thanks.

This is an excellent update.  Thanks for putting this together.

Dale/Patrick - lets regroup on how we want to move this onward.  Seems like 
SJ's suggestion of our spending more time with Bill Dwyer is a good one.

Thanks

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

They look like a startup S/W vendor so I'm not sure how big the opportunity 
will be.

Jennifer, can you please keep us in the loop as this progresses.

Jennifer,

Thanks for hosting the meeting yesterday. Sorry I had to leave but I had to
meet with Beth Pearlman. I believe there was a lot of good information
exchanged and that is why we ran so late. I certainly came away with a
different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met.

Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some
things are very clear in our go forward strategy.

At the end of the day, the account team (Dave Spurlin up through Jeff,
myself and Jerry) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship. If
corporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the
account. Peter Blackmore is very clear about that. He was always preserved
the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer.
That is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are
taking place within Enron.  He isn't the decision maker on deals like the
EBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other
business opportunities within Enron. Dave's sole responsibility is Enron and
making sure that your needs are being met. He will direct and assist in
making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the
relationship with Enron. I need your help with all Enron organizations to
make sure that they use Dave as the focal point. If folks continue to go
around him, situations like EBS will continue. He has to have the total
picture of business transactions happening at Enron. He will understand how
those situations can impact the business at and for Enron.

Secondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts
with Enron. Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the
sixth year being optional. The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per
year. I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years.
So at 5 years the value is $80.5M. If you have something different, let's
make sure that we are on the same page. I have attached the emails that I
received this data from.

 <<RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.>>  <<RE: Enron Building
Services Novi MI.>>

Regarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level
set very quickly. Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive
light. Compaq will honor it's commitments but we need to make sure that
Enron does the same. The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of
expectations relative to Compaq's revenue from EBS versus what actually got
booked. Our expectations were $96M a year  based on the forecast provided by
EBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday).  I find it
very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held
accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don't have the revenue to
off set it.  Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based
on expectations that were set. I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to
see how it was left.   I also need to get your perspective on the
transaction. Jennifer, if there is a business opportunity,  Compaq certainly
wants to continue in pursuing that with Enron. Provided it's equitable for
both sides.   I realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get
through it.


Jennifer, once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and
hosting Compaq. I will contact you later today.
Thanks,

  Michael,

  I left you a voice message today regarding Enron. I'm doing
a presentation and I would like to get the amount ($) of  contracts we
currently have with Enron Services. For example the $97M 5-year contract for
power. I understand that we have contracts in the Northeast and West for
facilities.

  Can you provide me with that kind of data? I would
appreciate it.

  My presentation is on the 14th of December.

  Any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

   Michael,
     Thanks for the update.  I am OK with your decision
not to select Enron (and I also reviewed with Jim Milton).  Given that Enron
chose not to rebid, I certainly think this is a reasonable decision.

     It is very important that I (and the Enron account
team) stay informed on all of these issues, so thanks again for keeping us
in the loop.

   Regards,
   Jerry

    Jerry,

    As part of our continuing communication with
the Compaq/Enron account team,  below is an overview of a recent bid
analysis for services at Compaq's Novi, MI site.   Enron Building Services
is the current service provider for Office Services related support.  The
proposed pricing received by Pitney Bowes is 11.1% or $15,147 lower than the
price provided by Enron.  Enron has been given the opportunity to revise
their pricing but has chose not to.  The recommendation is to award the
business to Pitney Bowes.   Please confirm that you concur with our
recommendation.    Thanks.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------
    Background: Enron Building Services was
providing a facility manager, shipper receiver, receptionist and admin/help
desk support for Compaq's Novi, MI site.  Compaq recently chose to hire the
facility manager as a permanent Compaq employee.  Enron Building Services
provided Compaq with revised pricing to reflect the modified scope of work.
The pricing provided by Enron was 11.1% higher than the price received by
Pitney Bowes.  The Enron account team has been informed that their pricing
is not competitive and they been given the opportunity to lower their price.
They have opted not to lower the price.  The recommendation of both Real
Estate and Procurement is to award the business to Pitney Bowes.


    Enron Building Services Current Cost:

      Base cost for services was
$190,198.00
       Admin/Help Desk
$44,787.00
       Ship/Rec
$35,521.00
       Receptionist
$38,610.00
       Facilities Manager
$71,280.00
      Mail Van/Car (remote site
support)   $13,030.00
      Management Fee
$14,210.00
      Total Cost
$216,438.00

    Compaq hired the facility manager as a
badged employee.

    Enron Building Services Proposed Cost:

    Base cost for remaining services
$128,071.00
       Admin/Help Desk
$53,940.00
       Ship/Rec

      Mail Van/Car (deleted)
      Management Fee
$8,324.00
      Total Cost
$136,395.00


    Issue: 20% increase in Admin/Help desk
cost.

provide Admin/Help Desk coverage, Shipper/Receiver, Receptionist for a total
cost of. $121,248.00 which is 11.1% less than EBS proposal.

I agree.  Sarah-Joy and I had a detailed follow-on conversation today about 
this topic, and we're in agreement as to how things can move forward.  I'd 
definitely like to have Bill rejoin our conversation with our new overall 
commercial contact at HP, whose name Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy will supply 
in the very near future.  I understand that Peter Goebel was quite clear with 
HP in today's meetings regarding the imminent nature of his wireless 
decision, the breadth of vendors with whom he could conceivably do business, 
and the fact that the wireless deal and the Enron sell side are inextricably 
linked.  Sarah-Joy mentioned that Gerry has not been present in the more 
recent conversations, which we're taking to indicate that Bill and Greg 
understand that his focus was different than ours.  

Sarah-Joy has brought immense focus and organization to this process.  I have 
certainly found her involvement invaluable.

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

Good Morning!

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer.   Any news on this?  

Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.


Appreciate it.

Hello Curtis,

sorry for the late response.
An upgrade from E1 to E3 is not an option for the mentioned locations, for
the foreseeable future.
The 2. proposal is also not an option for us, because we buy bandwidth on
demand and the demands change very dynamically, therefore such a plan would
not fit our requirements.

best regards Dietmar

Dietmar,
   Attached is a message from Enron Broadband Services on sizing the
proposal back to SAP.
Hopefully his attached message is clear in terms of finding a way to
structure it
for growth based on your needs.  This would increase the size of our
arrangement if it
makes good sense for you.  Please get back to me with your thoughts.

Curtis - following our phone call this morning I met with Matt Harris and
our
structuring person (Glenn Surowiec) to review the deal. After some quick
analysis it looks like we overestimated the opportunity.

The circuits Dietmar is requesting is a european E1 which equates to a US
T1.
The hub (Wallfdorf) -and-spoke (Hungary, Netherlands, UK) model SAP requires
works out to roughly a $2.09M deal.

Clearly this is smaller than both parties would prefer.Thus we would like to
know if there are growth plans for one or more of these connections so that
we
can we propose a larger pipe (i.e. European E3/US DS3).

For example if just one of the connections can be an E3 for the entire
contract
(ten years) it would bump the value up to $8.5M. Please review this and
let's
plan on talking later today. Another model to consider would be to
progressively
bump up the pipe size across all the connections at set intervals (i.e.
years
1-3 = E1, years 4-6 = E2, years 7-10 = E3).

Please let me know what your thoughts are and let's talk ASAP.

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - Quest is so far ahead 
technology-wise and cheaper.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be the best and would 
purchase it now if the other group was willing to cooperate.  I believe Jim 
Ogg wants to evaluate more tools and related design tools before making a 
decision.

Douglas

Chaz and Steve,

Here's the latest, in a nutshell.  Basically, the testing is not fully 
completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is 
also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the 
purchase decision).  As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out 
on vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas.  
However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to 
surmise that BMC is not in the driver's seat in either situation.

In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC's revenue opportunity with 
the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at 
EBS.  The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema 
Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, 
especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation.  

Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential 
vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC 
purchase at this point.  I will be on vacation next week, but will be 
checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th.  Jennifer or I will keep 
you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor.

I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug's most recent communication to 
me.  The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net 
Works teams in question:  more testing, but looks like BMC's total sales 
opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your 
deal done.  The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from 
yesterday still apply.

Thank you,

Jeff

Jeff,

We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - we feel that a competitor's 
solution is a better one for us.

My group still considers BMC's Schema Manager tool to be an excellent 
product, and would consider it to be a viable option for purchase.  I believe 
Net Works will still evaluate more similar tools, and related design tools, 
before making a decision.

Douglas

If you are referring to the Wireless call, I was on the call and actively 
participated with Peter G.  I had the agenda discussion items and  guided the 
conversation. The call was brief and enabled HP and Peter G. to discuss 
wireless initiatives briefly. Then Peter G. literally read from my notes the 
"message" you gave him about the need for HP to support the process on both 
the buy and sell sides.  

The call went well, message was delivered and Darrin will follow up with HP 
so they can come in to Enron and present the wireless intiative.

Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy (but not Gerry Cashiola) were on the call.  Greg 
Pyle made a note of saying that HP realized that they were going to have to 
fully support the process on both the buy and sell sides.

I will still connect back with Greg Pyle by phone.

Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron  cc:   Subject: FW: Fedex and other cross sells UPDATE



Jennifer:

In my absence, the only issues I expect to arise are the Fedex and HP deals.

For FEDEX:  (cross sell)  I will be speaking with Buck McGugan, VP of sales, 
Carmen Perez's boss's boss this morning at his office in Chicago.  
847-215-4241.  This is a follow up call to the calls from different Fedex 
business units which I have received.

(buy side--John Will)  I forwarded John's latest update earlier this week 
then his note below.  First, he had several conference calls with George 
Wasaff to John Pattillo.  John Pattillo had committed to getting back to John 
on Friday (he didn't) with the specifics of ABS' counter offer to FEDEX.  
John's e-mail below notes that on Friday 12/15 by noon he heard nothing back 
from Pattillo.  Second, John is to hear back from Carmen Perez today, Fedex 
account rep, on any news from Fedex lawyers and team regarding Fedex's 
response to lawsuit issue update.  Third, George Wasaff has made himself 
available to fly to Memphis with John this week if necessary and if this will 
help resolve the lawsuit issue in our favor.  Fourth, John has been told to 
begin to pull back business from FEDEX in terms of the GSS contractual 
relationship.  I've asked John to keep us in the loop on the developments 
with these four items and what he finally decides to do 12/22 on the Fedex 
account.

HP:  Wireless conference call with Peter G. went fine.  Peter G. has asked 
Darrin to set up a follow up meeting with HP after 1/8/01 when the Enron 
wireless team returns from London.  This is in progress.  EFS/Datawarehouse 
equipment meeting set for early Jan.  Spoke with Peter G.

I spoke with Bill Dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the 
opportunity to work more closely with Enron but would want to work in concert 
with the sales force.  My e-mailed question to you was as follows:  Do we 
just wait to hear back from Greg Pyle given your phone call to him and Peter 
G. message delivered to him on 12/14?


Kinko's:  Connected Mike Rabon to Kinko's CIO via conference call.  That 
enables the EBS proposition to move forward with Kinko's.  Also, connected Ed 
Quinn and Chris Charbonneau to VP of purchasing.  He is the initial decision 
maker.  Chris Charbonneau and I got on a follow up conference call with VP of 
Purchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from 
EIM Pulp & Paper team 9 months ago.  But, the offer was not as competitive as 
the options offered by the Kinko's paper mills.  Ed and Chris have some 
homework to do to improve the offer and get back to the VP of Purchasing.  
Once we get past this initial hurdle, I will work with Quinn and Charbonneau 
on getting to the CFO's office as necessary.  So, both sides are moving 
foward here.

Also, had Ed Quinn meet with Craig Brown and Tracy F.  on office automation 
(pulled Jeff Youngflesh up to speed as well) since he couldn't attend the 
meeting.  Ed had some great ideas for the process.


Continental:  Wasaff will speak briefly with Ron Howard on Wednesday at 1:30 
PM as a follow up thank-you.  Meeting minutes sent out.  Will be working with 
Craig Breslau and T. Ramsey in early Jan. meeting to get info. needed for 
airline ticket for fuel mgt. swap deal going.  Also, followup up with Tawney, 
Taylor, and Engberg (plastics) in early Jan.  Plastics will also be coming to 
GSS/BD to give educational overview.

CSC, Sonoco, Instromet followup in Jan. 2001.

Have a great holiday!  I will be checking my work voicemail daily weekdays 
(except Christmas day).

Sarah-Joy

fyi - our position is either pay the $2.5 million termination fee or pay the 
$4.1 million toward Compaq future purchases.  You will see a bcc of my EMail

Everett and Jim,

I have phone calls into both of you to gain your feedback and support on 
appropriate next steps with Compaq.   Everett, I am asking for your input as 
it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the 
relationship owners.  During the meeting yesterday - the following happened :
 a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately 
(his replacement has yet to be named).  My perception is that Keith took the 
hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales 
projections.   EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected 
targets.  
 b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his 
existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server 
Agreement 
 c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS 
Services.   For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed 
at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an 
8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters.  EBS sent 
Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th.   Compaq has not paid the 
invoice.  Lou Casari's team is handling the delinquency and notifying 
Compaq.  Compaq ( Keith M.'s stewardship) had agreed to pay.  Bob stated that 
EBS has not performed to Compaq's satisfaction under the Server Agreement and 
Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS 
services (Bob's first negotiation position).   
 d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in 
the EBS Server Spend amount.    
  Compaq (Bob Jordan) value  - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and 
hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)    - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million 
for servers and hardware in 2000
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in 
1999
  EBS (added)   - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional 
services (costs for Server deployment)

 From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the 
following might occur
  EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000  at 8% would equal a Compaq 
purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)
  Compaq total is $5.1 million spend  at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase 
amount of $408,000
  EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount 
is $4,134,229. (I did not concede) 

 e) 2000 income.   Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had 
to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could 
defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, 
2002.  If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the 
right to spend against the amount.  To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS 
worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS 
consulting services provided to Compaq.   Again, under Keith M's stewardship 
- they verbally agreed to pay. 

Now with the above information - my offered next steps :
 a) Until everything is done - maintain the "stick" of the EBS invoice ($4.1 
million).  This is being done.
 b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee.   It 
does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages.  Prior 
conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee 
(again with Keith M).   This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. 
 c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on 
services of $4.1 million.   This is a good return for a commodity 
transaction.  So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier 
relationship.   

 So...... please let me know your thougths.   We have countered with the $2.5 
million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000.  

Please let me know your thoughts

Mr. Shankman:

In preparation for the meeting on December 11th with Larry Kellner, CFO, 
Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the 
Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  We would 
appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.

Background:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year 
with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic 
Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader,  to review the strong 
business relationship in fuel management and travel services which  Enron has 
had with Continental Airlines.  Discussions were held as to how this 
relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.

A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both 
companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to 
expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in 
weather derivatives and plastics hedging.

December 11th Meeting Purpose:  Follow-up from October 25th meeting to 
specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th 
meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude:  (1) fuel management, 
(2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.

Location:  Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his 
availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor.  If he can make it for 
a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he 
is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 
Smith Street.  Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific 
preference?

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, 
we have coordinated through John Nowlan.  At the October 25th meeting,  Alan 
Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather 
derivatives opportunities, respectively.  

Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines  Enron's 
current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed 
initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging.  Larry 
Gagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing 
input on this.

Sarah-Joy,
Here is an update per your request.

Per our conversation yesterday, you had noted that John Pattillo would be 
getting back to you with his decision as to how he would approach FEDEX with 
an Enron counteroffer.   Any news on this?  

I spoke to John briefly this morning.  Fed-Ex (Memphis) has not been in 
contact with our legal all last week.  John supports our move today to begin 
moving business to UPS.  I have left a message to Carmen to call me ASAP.  My 
message is to inform her of our movement of significant corporate office 
business beginning today. I have every expecation that Carmen will call me 
back this afternoon.  Since the discussions aren't happening, I doubt that we 
will be flying to Memphis, but I'll advise of any changes as they occur.


Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop 
regarding:

a) John Pattillo's decision 12/14;
b) Carmen's feedback by close of business Monday 12/18
c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22
d) if you follow up on George Wasaff's offer to fly to Memphis next week if 
necessary
and e) if you need to pull back on Enron's contracts with Fedex.

Greg,

 I really appreciated the time you spent with Derryl and I last week.  It was 
an excellent start to developing the significant opportunities that will 
benefit both GSS and NEPCO.  I look forward to continuing to work with you to 
deliver value to the NEPCO bottom line.

 I have attached meeting minutes from last Thursday's meeting, including 
action items for some of the areas we discussed.  One of the action items is 
to set a follow up in January for a GSS analytical team to gather data in 
your offices, and to begin developing specific supply strategies.  I met with 
the other SPLs this morning and identified the team members we would plan to 
send.  At the moment we would like to target January 30th and 31st for our 
follow-up.  I will work with the team to develop a specific agenda for that 
visit and will forward it to you by January 8th.

 Please let me know if you have any additions, deletions or changes to the 
attached minutes. 

        Happy Holidays,

David and Bob,

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS 
relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities 
(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.  
After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin 
as the point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from 
Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith 
McAuliffe or Kent Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending 
additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business 
opportunities and issues.  

EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop 
the streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th 
meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product 
and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media 
solutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the 
intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these 
solutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the 
appropriate next steps to further our relationship.  

The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework 
for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until 
those changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq 
was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 
7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice 
amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 
on or before December 31,2000.   
2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, 
Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   
The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written 
notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a 
new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  
EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if 
Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we 
look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.  

Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create 
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Jeff,

As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater 
involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on 
the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction 
was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   

In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to 
fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in 
August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and 
identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at 
least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both 
EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq 
Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between 
both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time 
was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq 
(Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 
sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for 
comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  
During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain 
points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed 
to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS 
concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate 
the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the 
development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   

EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with 
our relationship.

Kim,

Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, Dave
Spurlin "Owns" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.
All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your life
easier.

Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; My
reaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enron
and Compaq.  We are both exposed to potential unnecessary pitfalls that are
clearly evident in the original agreement.

We look forward to resolving this issue, amending this agreement, and moving
forward in the partnership between Enron and Compaq.

Sincerely,

David and Bob,

We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS
relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities
(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.
After
our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the
point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaq
to
direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or
Kent
Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time
with
David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and
issues.

EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop
the
streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting
that
there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server
Supply
Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS and
Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product
and
Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS has
had
internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our
relationship.

The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework
for
our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until those
changes are made:
1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq
was
invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,
2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice
amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section
3.0 on
or before December 31,2000.
2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,
Compaq
(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   The
understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice
and
payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a new
contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBS
strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq
believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look
forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.

Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create
strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Bob, David and Jeff,

Please find the following EMail as a piece of the EBS / Compaq history.   
This is the amendment language developed to address the five clarification 
points rasied during the EBS / Compaq meetings in August and September 
2000.   These meetings were held to gain mutual understanding and clearly 
identify the requirements of the January 2000 Product and Server Supply 
Agreement.  

Bob, I appreciated the honesty and perspective shared between us this 
morning.   I look forward to resolution of these perspectives. 

thanks,

Kim

Derrick,

Please find attached proposed language for the Amendment to address the four 
items that we discussed today in our Conference Call.   We believe that this 
will achieve discussed changes to the Server Purchase and Product Supply 
Agreement.   We look forward to resolving this in a timely fashion and thank 
you in advance for your assistance.

Recently we signed Letters of Interest (LOI's) with three brokers.  The 
letters contemplate our interest in providing these brokers with the ability 
to execute on behalf of their customers on EnronOnline.  Below are the terms 
of these transactions as outlined in the LOI's.  I have contacted many of the 
desk heads prior to entering into the LOI's and outlined the general terms of 
these transactions (J Arnold, J Nowlan, K McGowan, U Ek, S Hastings, K 
Presto,J Hawthorn).  We are also in discussions with the following brokers E 
D & F Man (US Gas and US Power), GFI (global gas, power, coal and emissions), 
PVM (European Crude and Products), and Prebon (world-wide gas & power).  We 
would appreciate if you could give us the names of additional brokers we 
could talk to that are active in your products.

Please pay particular attention to the Amerex terms which include the ability 
to initiate executions telephonically using website prices.  Enrons 
obligation to transact telephonically on website prices are good faith only.  
This term allows Amerex to get around a exclusivity clause with Altra which 
they are trying to negotiate out of.

Please review the terms and contact me at (ext 3-0397) concerning any 
comments or concerns that need to be addressed prior to the execution of 
definitive agreements.

Chaz & Steve,

I was able to review our recently completed conference call w/BMC with 
Jennifer Medcalf.  

During the call, Bernie Goicoechea and Ann(e?) Munson expressed that during 
their last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they have 
attempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works has 
with regard to selection/use of BMC's products.  Bernie voiced that he hasn't 
been able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that Net 
Works has, beyond what you and I know.  The BMC account team feels that 
without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely 
fashion.

The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are 
not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and 
not in writing).  Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the 
(Net Works) team's feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) "...haven't 
kept up with the industry", and that they (Net Works) have some residual 
issues with the BMC account support in general.  Bottom Line, expressed by 
Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC 
software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.

You related Jim Crowder's suggestion related to the use of indemnification 
and liquidated damages clauses being implemented.  Jennifer and I discussed 
this situation, and our meetings with your team, in context.  We have a 
possible alternative for you to consider:  perhaps EBS might provide a hedge 
for Net Works in the form of "advance purchase" of BMC product.

For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but 
needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total 
Enron purchases from BMC.  A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark 
with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC 
time to "click" might be this:  EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC 
software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other 
$2 million is used as a "future purchases" fund, in which EBS buys, but does 
not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current 
software...

THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of 
BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is 
delivered from/by BMC.  That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other 
business units aren't spending any of today's dollars for product which they 
seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product 
when they need it in the future).  In addition, you secure the business with 
BMC right now.  I'm sure you could also figure out how to account for the 
time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to 
you.

If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the 
meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on 
progress.

Thanks,

Jeff

Susan Scott, Larry's risk manager, will compile and send you a spreadsheet of 
total p&l minus new deal p&l since June 1.   Can you review this data and 
compare it to the respective VAR numbers for these dates.  I think you will 
see the VAR numbers way overestimate his p&l volatility.

Subject: Re Larry May - REVISED


John,
I apologize for the delay in responding, I was in class today.
We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR.   It looks as if during 
the month of June, the book administor  loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but 
assigned multiple master deal ID's.  (the code is "NG-OPT-XL-PRC")
For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: 
June 1st  $797 million dollars loss
June 2nd +192 million dollars made
June 5th $300 million dollars made... (etc..)

This problem makes it impossible to backtest....

Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the 
allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily 
increasing your limit to $45 million.  This limit increase is in effect until 
July 26th.  The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution 
can be devised..... 

I hope this helps.
Thanks,
Frank

Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer 
term Vol problem until we change formulas?

In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
 no right answer.  some examples are  strength or weakness in financial basis 
and index markets, customer flow, cash/futures spread, technical  analysis, 
storage projections, price action, etc.
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
 goal is to see how much he analyzes the fundamentals of the market
  weather - does candidate look at weather models such as american, european, 
and canadian operational runs or does he just     subscribe to  a weather 
service
  storage - has he built an aga forecasting model or does he just wait for 
others to tell him projections
  production - has candidate dug into eia production data, company specific 
drilling results, or state specific (such as texas railroad     commission 
reports)
  end of season storage number - has candidate built a longer term forecast 
of where we end up in storage.  
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?
if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero?
Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts?
If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal?
what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if 
corresponding futures are trading $5?
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

Thanks a million for your input.
I was wondering if you could outline some good responses to these questions.

With your interpretation of a good response, or points to consider, this will 
be a great resource for other interviewers.

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

Do you have a simulation set up that will allow me to simulate trades by 
pushing a buy or sell button and will move the two way so i can try 
simulating actual market cicumstances?

Subject: 


John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally "False"


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

         INPUTS           OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  >220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  <30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  <10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  <4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  >3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  >20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). 
Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate 
margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the 
front, they are also buying back summer.  el paso large buyer of next winter 
today taking off spreads.  certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong 
on the way up and such a piece now.   really the only one left with any risk 
premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, 
down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish 
to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments 
for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was 
trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of 
probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that 
has to be reflected in h/j.

Sarah,

Thanks to you and Jennifer for arranging.   I will be in attendance at 3:00 
pm and have asked either Jim Crowder or Everett Plante to also attend.   I do 
not know their availability yet due to the Enron PRC meeting conflicts.   Is 
it possible for me to attend starting at 1:00 pm - I have not been through a 
complete Experience Enron meeting ?

thanks again for your help.

Kim

Mike- I have their trader coming into the office tomorrow- they are a macro 
fund (they manage Harvard's endowment fund) that trades commodities- mostly 
crude and metals.  I want to get them into some gas and power trades.  
Specifically, I want to get them into the short Rockies trade for the summer 
that we have Tudor in.  

Johnny recommended I have you speak to them- can you give me a few minutes 
during the day to talk to them about the west in general.

I have him in all day- we are sitting with Mike Roberts to do the weather 
update from 6 am-7:30 - would be great if we could get you between 7:30 and 
8:30 am.  If not, let me know when is good- Ina will know where I am

Rgds,
Caroline

absolutely agree.  the thought is always, even if cash is piece of shit 
today...wait until the future.  here's my question: what is the environment 
whereby f/g is worth $.50.   is there a market scenario where this happens?

i can think of is will they get concerned over this industrial slowdown going

wish i had a stronger view-my view combined with year end give me just strong
enuf bias not to do anything. its nuts-but you pted out something a while back
is this indistries abilty to keep a contango-we dont have that but they
certainly doing their best. for cash to be at huge premiums and cold weather 
up
front like we have nt had in years, 15 dollar ny, 50 socal, 10 buck hub-shit
whats it take, not like theres huge spec lenght left.
    i guess to the extent mkt is sooo concerned about running out in 
march-they
gonna keep a huge premium in whats left of the winter strip vs summer, and 
they
shud. cash loan deals have to keep hedged lenght in mar there fore makes em
strong so long as they stay way below ratchets. other thing worries me about 
jan
is cash tite but will steadily get some relief from switching, proocessing
margins negtive , dist, resid, nukes coming up, then on day we come in and 
they
say weather going above normal 1 st 10 days of jan... BAM guess they wack it.

and yes apr/may i think is nuts, mar/apr i dont in part cuz apr whud be a 
dog. i
cant figure out how and when best way to short it/hedge my bet

  dont know-im leaving it alone, the cash makes it a jan/feb a compelling but
too many ifs, yes and dec/jan expirey, wud have thot cash wud recverse the
psychology. but not. im pretty lost john and the risks are bigger than i care 
to
take till january-spending next cuplpa weeks formulating some long term
strategies in both natgas and oil. and try not to gain anymore weight before 
the
new year.

I know it will be close to impossible to get out but I wanted to invite you 
to our Christmas party on Dec 20 here in NYC- we'd love if you came.  If not, 
in the new year, I hope we can set something up where you meet some of the 
new funds we are dealing and have some fun up here.

I met someone good to work with you guys at this last Super Saturday- David 
Larson- Berkeley- good derivatives, trading knowledge, personable.  I'll fax 
through resume- we are making him an offer for the analyst pool.

John,
Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. 

First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock 
liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the 
plant, so that wouldn't help. 

Second, it seems there are more of these "portable pipeline" units floating 
around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas 
(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has 
one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. 
Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are 
about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic 
feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said 
yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the 
pipeline system in California. 

This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG 
consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that 
he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested 
in looking further into transporting LNG into California. 

Assuming that we could get a few "portable pipelines" and some trucks, there 
are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:

Location Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage 
(gal) Storage (mmcf)
Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2
LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2
Sacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8
LaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92      
Evanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2

Totals         26.48

Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The 
Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to 
providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with 
LNG fleet owners. 

I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting. Message-ID: <15036793.1075857570828.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

>Rabbi Zimmerman, which it did not specify other than to say that

>about the conference's 1,700 members.
>
> Rabbi Menitoff said that conference rules prevented him from

>
> It is included in the section of the code on "personal

>
> Hebrew Union, which trains men and women as rabbis and cantors and
>in other graduate and professional fields, has 1,500 students on

>Emanu-El in Dallas from 1985 to 1995, and senior rabbi at Central
>Synagogue in New York, from 1972 to 1985. He is married and has
>four children. From 1993 to 1995, he was also the conference's
>president.
>
> Rabbi Zimmerman's resignation was first reported yesterday in The
>Cincinnati Enquirer and The Dallas Morning News.
>
> Efforts to reach him through the college and its officials were
>unsuccessful. The college said it appointed its provost, Norman
>Cohen, as acting president and would search for a permanent
>replacement.
>
> Rabbi Menitoff said the conference followed "the same process that

>committee's findings, the conference may dismiss the complaint,
>privately reprimand or publicly censure a rabbi or suspendn or
>expel a rabbi.
>
> Rabbi Menitoff said the decision to suspend Rabbi Zimmerman was
>"very difficult and painful for everyone involved."
>
> Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew

Catherine:
Sorry it's been so long since I could respond.  With the craziness here I am 
way behind on everything.
#1. 3 years
#2.  volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility.  volume 
probably averaging 25000 these days.  EOL volume averaging around 14000.   
Very high percent of market.   Current market conditions shows why our 
transactional model of being one side of every trade is superior.  
#3.  good liquidity first 3 years.  okay liquidity years 4-6.
#4.  calendar 2004-2008 maybe 1 trade a day.  70% chance Enron is one side.  
calendar 2009-2013  very rare that it trades.

Subject: EIM Due Diligence: Nymex, Enron Gas Data

Per my voicemail, I've included a list of the Investors' questions and 
preliminary answers.  The answers are attempts by our group, Bob Crane and 
Bryon Hoskins but need confirmation by you.  Would you mind giving us some 
feedback for #4 as well?  I could not find these numbers.  These are again 
going to be forwarded to Bain Capital, the potential equity investor in the 
pulp, paper and steel net works fund.  They are in their final stages of due 
diligence and are comparing pulp and paper facts with gas.  (They are under a 
confidentiality agreement).  
Please call with any questions
Thank you,

1. # of years of NYMEX visibility on the typical gas curve.

3 years

2. # of daily trades on NYMEX, in total and for Enron specifically.

102,492 daily trades on NYMEX (11/28/00)and ours amounts to 8,061 per day 
(usually around 10% daily NYMEX trades)

3. length and nature of "price discovery" windows past the NYMEX portion of
the gas curve (e.g., 7 years of visibility provided by proprietary market
making past NYMEX, then 10 years of macro / industry average assumptions).

NYMEX price discovery equates to about 3 years. Liquidity of the market and 
proprietary market information equates to about 2 years after that with the 
remaining portion coming from more macro industry information.

4. trade volume data (# of daily trades as well) for each 5 year increment of
the gas curve beyond the NYMEX portion, in total and for Enron specifically.

a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to 
switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing 
plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the 
gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at 
$1....need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test 
of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management 
keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too 
many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy 
prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.  

funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 
friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each 
front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.  

what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas 
switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market 
too oversupplied to care?Message-ID: <238564.1075857570916.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

amazing how with cash futures at $1 and the back such a piece that f/g under 
such pressure.  month 2 has been the strongest part of the board all year.   
will be interesting to see what happens when h/j is prompt.  could j actually 
be strong?  seems like of the spreads on the board the best risk reward is in 
f/g.  a little worried about having the z/f effect again.  that is, all spec 
length trying to roll and funds trying to roll  at the same time leading to 
some ridiculous level at expiry.  any thoughts?

Re: trucking LNG to California - 

The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option 
for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a 
couple of reasons for this. 

First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only 
two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, 
affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military 
and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG 
Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck 
fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I 
was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is 
operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and 
Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern 
California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by 
ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and 
subsequent loading onto trucks.

Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The 
average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into 
820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could 
deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely 
transfer it into storage. 

The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would 
be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under 
repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 
mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a 
time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, 
ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some 
reason. 

I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. 
I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located 
peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. 

Please let me know if you have specific questions.

Russ:

A couple of questions
1- Check the DOE Northeast Heating season  report.   There seem to be a lot 
of LNG terminal and facilities in the Northeast. How do they work? What are 
the logistics of transportation etc...


2- Arnold's buddy has been looking into the logistics of  trucking LNG to CA. 
Is this possible? Can investigate the probability?

Hey freak-o!  How have you been?  I'm just taking a study break (finals,
ick!) and thought I would say hello.  What's new?  Have you moved into
your place yet?  Let me know if I can come and see it--I'll be home (in
college station) a week from Tuesday...am making a pit stop in Tahoe on
my way home...just gotta get thru these pesky exams first!

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel.  They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it.  Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

Vikas - What's the market in nat gas versus lard and heating oil versus olive 
oil

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel.  They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it.  Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

I'm not sure if you have heard our fun news yet, but Rob and I are moving to
Boston at the first of the year!!

I will be working remotely for HBK while looking for something new up there.
Rob is continuing his career with Fidelity, though in a much more convenient
location.  The only downside is he will actually have to go into the office
every day!

We would love to see everybody before we leave, though it may not be
possible with the holidays.  I'll be back in Dallas once a week in January
and February, so we could plan to get together during one of those trips.
But before that time, Rob and I will be with a group of friends from HBK at
Martini Ranch on Thursday, December 14th right after work.  I'm sure we'll
be there late, given my love of martinis, so please stop by if you can.

Regardless, I really want to stay in touch with my Texas friends, so make
sure and send me your updated contact information if anything has changed in
the last year.  Please pass this on to people who I may have inadvertently
missed or I did not have their current email address.

Cheers,
Heather Robertson



P.S.
By the way, our house is on the market right now, so if you know of anyone
looking, please tell them about it.  The address is 6815 Vivian Avenue,
Dallas, 75223 and can be seen on www.ebby.com.

A funny story:
Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of 
unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the 
exchange stopped trading for an hour.  
Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything 
was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange 
closing.  One yelled at Rappaport...

they are crazy but mite have to scale in which i have a little and have some
sort of length on,sprd length in the front to hedge weather risk-if ny stays 5
bucks or so above hub seems hard to think jan /feb gonna fall much. also know
aron and some of them "pre rolled" jan/feb goldman rolls not sure if they bot 
em
back, start pxing tomorrow.doubt they have much any impact on the sprd.
    am a bit worried as are most what we must be doing to industrial
demand,switching at huge px sprds. tend to think ealry mid jan y on y stx gap
will fall do to aforementioned and rationing this mkt gonna fall-who knows 
from
what levels?? thots when you have a chance. distillate mkt save for addional
demand it shud be getting from natgas switching wud have been in trouble i

Can Alan Engberg have an alternate at the meeting?  Lee Jackson could do a 
great job -- he wrote the recent article on plastics and petrochemicals which 
came out in the last Analyst/Associate Encounter newsletter.

John- 

What do you think of getting a direct mic from New York to Houston as soon as 
possible?  We had one at my last employer from NY to London which worked 
great.  You can tun it on or off but it allows us to communicate without 
getting on the darn phone - I am sure its a total annoyance to pick us up.

The steno is still a phone to me and its not recorded. 

We could keep it between you and Mike. 

We are getting a few more funds to trade now- some program guys among them 
who will need quicker execution.  I know you and Per have discussed the idea 
of them calling you direct but I think, for now, the mic is a better answer.  
I can sit down with you when I am down there to discuss and give you an 
update of who we are planning to trade with.

Best Rgds,
Caroline

Subject: For What It's Worth.

Through the year's (Sounds like Im really old) I have learned that the really 
great Individuals come down on themselves for circumstances beyond their 
control when in fact their performance is far beyond what anyone else could 
have done.  I believe you are one of those individuals.  I appreciate what 
you have done with EOL and the burden you have had to take on.  This 
especially hits home when I see what has happened to you P/L the last 3 
months.  You are expected to carry the world without having any NYMEX 
liquidity to cover your risk.  I would like to offer to transfer $30 million 
out of the Storage Book to the Price Book.  Without you and EOL I could never 
have done what I've done. 

 Thanks,

Hey, I meant to check in with you and see how your dinner went at La Columbe 
d'Or.   I have to admit, I was jealous....

Matt fell through as the Christmas party date...so Noel is going (so nice to 
have friends who don't mind filling in as last minute dates!).  Maybe we'll 
see you guys there.

Had fun hanging out with you at/after the meeting on Friday.  I think that's 
the most I've ever talked to you in one sitting!!  We'll have to do it again 
soon....

Take care!

Larry,

Thank you for getting back with me.  To answer your question:  It is looking 
more and more like the week of January 8th.  The meetings would be held using 
approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window:  the 9th, 10th, and 11th.  I have 
input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a 
tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th.  

I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) 
which each would be attending.  For example, you would probably attend both 
days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day 
meetings.  I'm not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G. 
certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems 
Engineer(s).

I will call you this week to get your input re:  who from your team would be 
going, and for which days.

Thank you,

Jeff

better time to meet, but I could also consider the December dates.

Mission/Purpose:  Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below.  

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.  


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.  EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & 
marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.  I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Jeff

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't 
have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be 
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
possible alternates...

Thank you,

Jeff

As a recent transfer into the analyst program, I have moved to a new group: 
EnronCredit.com, based
in London but I will be working here.   I will be working mainly with credit 
derivative traders.

I am at the same phone number, 3-3528, and completely enjoyed my role working 
with you
in the Nymex checkout function for the past 1 1/2 years.

Joe Hunter will be taking my place while a replacement is found.

Best wishes to each of you at Enron.

Z/F !!!!   wow.    Who would have thunk it.  Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as 
wide as last year.  Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.  
Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango.   if it 
couldn't do it this year....
A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve 
told them to do last bid week.  Obviously, more gas trying to come out than 
is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an 
Enron, to inject.  Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling 
it out in G.  When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, 
cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  Storage 
economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of 
winter.  Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.  
Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.  storage boys 
are withdrawing today and buying that.   bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it 
going to zero?

agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up 
buying
em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month

fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time 
is
busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with
calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have 
the
time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but
one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called 
impact
of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate 
at
all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon.
   also will be curious how these "loan deals" by pipes work ouut. man these
guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash
hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in 
the
back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep
that part of the curve very strong agree?
  be cool my man-talk later

Carrie,

I hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

We would like to change the date for the Compaq Experience ENRON request I 
submitted online.   Originally the date was 12/13, we would like to

Mr. Thompson:

Thank-you for your time this morning as we reviewed progress on the=20
Kinko's/Enron relationship and discussed how we might move forward with the=
=20
appropriate individuals at Kinko's who could help us define "value=20
propositions."
=20
As we mentioned, we would like to have a conference call and/or meeting wit=
h=20
Kinko's "solutions architects" who could work with us on further defining =
=20
broadband and pulp & paper initatives.  If these discussions were held befo=
re=20
the holidays, this would enable us to prepare both for the Experience Enron=
=20
event which will be held January 5th, 2001 from 9-11 AM and for subsequent=
=20
executive level meetings.

For example, someone who could answer questions regarding communication=20
transit possibilities with kinkos.com and other broadband-related questions=
=20
would be helpful in this endeavor.  Often, this information comes to us=20
through the IT organization such as a direct report to the CIO or CTO.  =20
Additionally, someone from the Finance organization (direct report to the=
=20
CFO) could address the following types of questions regarding Kinko's paper=
=20
usage:

Of Kinko's overall costs, where does paper rank?
Does Kinko's have long-term (1-7 years), fixed pricing for copy paper?
Can Kinko's pass-through paper price increases on to its customers?

Mr. Thompson, I have taken the liberty of attaching the Meeting Minutes fro=
m=20
the October 6th meeting as background information of our discussions.

Thank-you for your help.  I can be reached at:  #(713)-345-6541 and look=20
forward to speaking soon.

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

contact on Connectivity issues discussed at our last meeting.  He is well on 
the way to identifying the appropriate person who could speak with our EBS 
team .

We'll catch up on the Storage Services conference call December 7th at 10 AM!

John - the FIMAT loan agreeemnt will prohibit ENE from using loan proceeds as 
follows:
No part of the proceeds of any Advance hereunder will be used for 
"purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings 
of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect.

Do you know whether you engage in purchasing or carrying margin stock?  I 
will check with legal as well.

Hey:
Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others 
wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6 
months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are 
amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will 
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely 
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.  
Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.  
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.  
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until 
latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be 
unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one 
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.   
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a 
very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.  
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been 
significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they 
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some 
back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 
considering the scenario that's being painted.

johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for
me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled 
all
the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas
therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was 
long
mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early
  flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a
flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained
aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.

   but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to 
mark
silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no
idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. 
any
great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.
   guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling 
dry
up??

Hello:

I've been tasked with getting tickets to a show.  Was it 'Blue Men Group'
that you recommended we see?  And Michelle lives on W43rd, so it's not
as bad as you thought.

The attached report contains an analysis of fuel switching capability. It 
also details one  of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data  
contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no 
longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost  and quality of 
generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets 
around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were 
significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and 
deregulation at the state level.

Jennifer:

Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity 
with Kinko's as he sees it.  I would like to forward this on to James 
Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and 
cc Mike Rabon).  Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it 
overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary 
King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?

Thanks for your suggestion!  SJ




Mr. Thompson:

Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband 
Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate 
broadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met Mike 
Rabon in the October 6th meeting. 

Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had 
expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.
IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.
IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.
Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about 
your storage strategy and growth.
Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the 
actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the 
hubs.
Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality 
H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like to 
speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.
Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be 
communicated to the proper person.

The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate 
unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 
8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and 
Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore 
count as a total of four deals.     

We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as 
just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL 
Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals 
are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this 
currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most 
conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results 
in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.

If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.

Dear Mr.. Lavorato,

The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our
account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to
have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds
are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.

Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.

2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the
beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new
instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.

REGARDS
MARIA.

Hello Mr. Arnold,

I hope that things have calmed down in the gas market with the cold weather
finally developing.  I have been selected to come to Houston for final round
interviews.  Do you know if visitors can come to the trading floor to see
what the operations are like?  Also, if you have any hints on approaching
the final round of interviews, I would appreciate them.

Thank you for your help during the application process, and I hope you have
a good week.

Cordially,

I had Devon put together a resume for you to get an idea of his experience to 
date. He's not our typical MBA Associate, but I feel he has great potential 
as a junior trader.  I'll call you later to discuss. Per

John,

Thanks for the email and the offer to route my resume in the most
expeditious way.  I saw only one job that was posted on Enron's website that
looked like a good fit.  It was an asset evaluation and integration job for
Enron North America: job # 0000105886.

My primary strengths are:

Natural gas asset acquisition and management
Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and
derivatives execution
Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a
competitive reason to be     in the market, i.e. transportation spreads,
storage, physical presence
Good customer relations/account development
Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities
Stong negotiator

I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have
someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities.  Where I am coming
from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is
doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every
trend imaginable in leveraging itself.

I appreciate any help you can provide.

Thanks.

Alan

Subject: Vengas venue / Venezuela

I want to pass on my sincere appreciation for the excellent work and 
assistance from Colleen Koenig during last weeks crisis management program in 
Venezuela.  Colleen was more than helpful and provided services that I found 
invaluable.  She was extremely well liked by the senior management of Vengas 
and spent a great deal of time with them in creating an environment conducive 
to teamwork and productivity.  Her language skills, knowledge and personality 
provided an incredible resource.  Thanks for allowing my program her services 
and I look forward to working with her again in the future.

We have a number of key initiatives in process with Continental including 
sales of broadband services, weather derivatives and facility management that 
have the potential to exceed the savings being offered by British Airways.  I 
would prefer that we stay the course with Continental plus I am confident 
that Continental can either meet or exceed BA's current offer.

George,

Enron Europe has negotiated a preferred supplier agreement with British 
Airways which will save us circa $3m a year vs Continental Airlines. I know 
there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me 
know if this causes you a problem. Colin Bailey is in Houston next week if 
you need or want to know any of the detail.

CSFB informed us today that their Appalachia hedging deal will likely happen 
in the next two weeks. The deal, in short, involves Enron buying an average 
volume of 11,500 mmBtu/d at TCO and 5,500 mmBtu/d at CNG for 12 years and 1 
month from Dec00. 
CSFB would like to get an idea of where the market is now. I've attached a 
spreadsheet that details the volumes, which decline with time. Could you 
please provide indicative prices, as of tonight's close. 
Thanks,
Russ

I talked to Jay Surles and Kenny Policano at Adams Resources and concerning 
CATDADDY and POWERTRADE.  I informed Jay that it was in violation of their 
agreement to "sell, lease, retransmit, redistribute or provide directly or 
indirectly,any portion of the content of the Website to any third party."   
They indicated that they had provided the id to one of their marketers in New 
England.  They also suggested that they had a broker that watched spreads for 
a commission therefore theoretically the broker was an employee of the 
company.  After all the bull they agreed to have them shut down and they 
would refrain from doing it again.

Let's hope I don't get shot.

Thad,

Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us 
which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual 
meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to 
choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the 
western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in 
NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th 
of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  

However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I 
need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' 
availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The 
meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for 
the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of 
meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible 
alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:

1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential 
solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and
2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to 
determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the 
(common) markets served:  "sell with" (each other); and "sell through" 
(channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as 
sales channels for each other's sales forces.

These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would 
include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss 
areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value 
propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a 
go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of 
some of the 
"EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item 
#1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be 
addressed.

Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for 
your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to 
Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days 
synchronized with your executives'.  

Thank you,

Jeff

John,

Looks like IT has decided not to install Internet Explorer 5.5 after all.  
The program is ready to go as soon as that is installed.  Do you want to put 
some pressure on them, or would you rather wait to see if they can fix it to 
work on IE 5.0?  You have 5.5 by the way, so I'm not quite sure what the 
problem is.

Brian,

We are not good to go here.  These are high profile traders and I do not want 
to install IE55 just for this chatting application.  I would like for 
Fangming to resolve whatever the problem is with IE5 first and go from there.

Again, sorry to be a pain and I understand your situation, but developers 
should not develop applications with unsupported dependencies.

John,

So are we good to go to install IE 5.5?  From you email yesterday, I was 
under the impression that we were.  I understand that you guys need to keep 
the integrity of the system, but these guys really need this program ASAP.  

Again, if you need additional support, we can get that for you.  Just let me 
know what you need to resolve the problem.

Thanks,
Brian

All,
As John suggested, I have contacted the Microsoft Expert on the IE 5.0/5.5 
issue early this morning. We actually had a conversition over the phone. I 
also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything 
from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this 
browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their 
PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really 
not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is 
ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. 

Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard 
application. 

Thanks,

Fangming

Jennifer,

I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably 
about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC:

Based on the following, I would say this:

1)  BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works, 
and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully.
2)  Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or 
acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore
3)  BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify 
what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works.
4)  I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any 
of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided 
any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works & EBS on 
11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for 
information relative to "what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation, 
Net Works?" from Net Works.
5)  So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by 
Net Works) than will be discussed, because
6)  Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions.  Period.

7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net 
Works' folks are concerned.

In the "I don't want any surprises" mode, I thought I'd give George a 
heads-up re:  possible fallout around the BMC thing.  I told George in this 
morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team ("I 
don't see a problem here..."), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and 
implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for "credit", which any ENE business 
unit could access, etc.  I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were 
likely to encourage Crowder to "lean on" Philippe (which I had recommended 
against).  George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Jeff

Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the 
deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on 
the deal.  
Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical 
deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.

Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging Deal

The New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for 
roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured 
deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the 
next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken 
care of. 

In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and 
CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against 
the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from 
December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from 
roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 
17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the 
producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with 
more details. 

There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to 
clarify. 

First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like 
payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both 
the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the 
December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment 
would take place on February 15, 2000. 

Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. 
Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and 
Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we 
would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron 
Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. 
(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've 
done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). 

 There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with 
the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with 
EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. 
However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this 
transaction.

CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split 
it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting 
with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. 
Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end 
of this week. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Regards,
Russ

Brian,

I apologize if I didn't make myself clear over the phone.  There is a process 
that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with 
existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it 
is for a small subset of the population.  Furthermore, all applications must 
be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the 
desktops.  As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to 
install the application itself.

Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?  It is installed 
with IE5 and provides real time chat.

I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at 
this time.

Regards,

-jkc

John,

I talked to Fangming, and unfortunately, her program is not compatible with 
IE 5.0.  Let's proceed with the installation of IE 5.5.  This is an extremely 
important program that all of the traders will be using.  If you need 
additional resources, I can arrange for this.  Just let me know what you 
need.  

These are the people we need to set up with the upgraded version.

Thanks,
Brian

Andy, Here is what I am aware of regarding availability of EOL for Sunday 
Trading.

The first Sunday that we opened for trading (I believe it was 10/1), we 
experienced a shutdown of the entire site late Saturday which, unfortunately 
included our monitors, which is why we were not aware of it until just prior 
to trading time.  Trading was to open at 2:00pm and we had the site up by 
aprox 2:15pm.

I am not aware of any issues on 10/8 and 10/15.

This past Sunday, 10/22 we had a problem with a release that we pushed out on 
Saturday.  We are working on our release procedures and will make every 
effort to have smoother releases in the future.

I hope this answers your questions, if not feel free to give me a call.

I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed

EOL had problems on Sunday.  Anything you can do to improve reliability would 
be appreciated.

Jennifer,
In regard to the costs for the GAM conference, Karen told me the $ 6,695.97 
figure was inclusive of all the items for the conference.  However, after 
speaking with Shweta, I found out this is not the case.  The CDs are not 
included in this figure.  

The CD cost will be $2,011.50 + the cost of postage/handling (which is 
currently being tabulated).

Hi,

This is the original quote for this project and it did not include the 
postage. As soon as I have the details from the vendor, I'll forward those to 
you.
Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Hi,

We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:

1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50
2 . The distribution cost (minimum for 500 CD's)   - $ 355.00
     This will include the padded envelope, the address labels, the packing 
and deliver to the post office, but the postage is not included. 
3 . The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming - 
$ 770.00

So the total amount is approx. $2,011.50. The total time would be about 8 
days. These are approximate figures only.

If you have any questions you can call Karen Hunter at X56228. or I can be 
reached at X55706.

Thanks,
Shweta.

Hi,

If you sent a bank wire on Monday then it should take about 2-3 days to
be credited to your account, but sometimes it takes one or two days
longer.  So, if you don't see it today, please give us a call at 888 304
2206 and ask for either Maria or Juliette in the accounts department and
they will assist you.

Thanks,

I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed 
the opening until 6:05.  This is the third time in four or five sessions when 
EOL had problems on Sunday.  Anything you can do to improve reliability would 
be appreciated.

Adam:
Hope your interview goes well.  Things are going crazy in the gas market so, 
unfotunately, I'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews.  

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.  
Be confident.  Answer the question asked.  Don't be afraid to say you don't 
know but don't make excuses.  Express interest in why you find Enron 
appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.  

The trading training program is still in the works.  Few people outside the 
trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask 
any questions about it in the interviews.  If you receive an offer, it would 
probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the 
training program when you arrive.  Not sure about that last statement 
though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure 
trading business areas: gas and power.  There are still a large number of 
other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall 
under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the 
head of these two businesses.  Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.

Write me about how your interviews went.
Good luck:
John

Hi John,

How are you today?  You must be pleased with Enron's most recent numbers.
Could you tell me a little more about the trading training program?  You
mentioned you wanted to expand it to two years, but what does the extra year
entail?  I have been selected for an interview next Monday, and I look
forward to seeing you again.  Do you have any tips on approaching the
interview process?  I have poured over the company website, and if you have
any tips I would love to hear them.

Thanks for your time, and I hope to see you Monday.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer

Hello

I hear from Leonard that he had a very good meeting with you last week in
Houston.  We are hearing from quite a few people and the business is
beginning to flow.   On that subject Leonard did pass on to me that the
signed contract is "on the way".

The purpose of this e-mail is inquire about Enron's ability to
provide/supply natural gas to our company.  We consume quite a bit of
natural gas relatively speaking in our aluminum furnace.   I believe last
year we spent about $500,000.

As we both know the price of natural gas is rising.  It never hurts to check
and see if better deals are out there.  If this is of any interest, please
pass on to the appropriate person/group who would handle.  The can contact
me first and then I will turn over to our person here.  Thanks

It's funny the spreads in gas.  First, in gas, you can play the seasonality 
game.  Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back.  No, of course not.  But in 
crude, m/n at .10 back is normal.  definitely a game as you try to keep month 
on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads 
and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.  
that's why cal 2 is as high as it is.  
when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt 
month.  i can't remember w/o looking at charts.  it's always the mentality 
of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter.  i think that's 
why the winter spreads are a piece.  the z/f/g fly is interesting.  i think 
z/f can and will settle backw.  just a high prob it goes cantango first.
Still seeing sellside interest in term.  definitely a result of pira.  will 
probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them 
and watches the front of the curve.  previous to that conference, the 
producers just didnt want to sell anything.  tired of writing us a big check 
every month.
so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so 
i can work at home at night.  it's really my only time to sit and think 
without the phones and eol going crazy.  they better pay me for the decline 
in my lifestyle .

what is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again 
the
numbers but pretty sure they said  +3 bcf by dec. ill let you  know/its been
along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i know
this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering
if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for
only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today.
    some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk 
too
they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing
deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be 
hard
to maintain unless we have crazy weather. we're only 2 weeks from withdrawel
period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds 
until
all the length bails.
    your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px
to make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at 
pira
including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a
win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap.
   fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on
natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you 
be
careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there will
be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs
negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to
natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on 
oil
side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im
surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks
getting hit lately??
   good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you 
some
interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up.
    by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of my
biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections next
summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.

We need you -- for the Management Conference video

We are working with the Office of the Chairman in preparing a video that 
celebrates how Enron has reinvented itself many times over in the last 15 
years, which is the theme of this year's Enron Management Conference.  We 
will be videotaping members of the Enron Executive Committee this week who 
will be sharing and swapping stories with each other about Enron's past.  
Then we will fast forward to today -- that's where you come in.  We want each 
of you to talk about what you and your group are doing right now that 
represent how Enron continues to change and reinvent itself.

We will be videotaping October 24 and 25 in EB-50M05.   Please call or e-mail 
Marge Nadasky on Ext. 36631 as soon as possible to schedule a time that works 
best for you on either of these days.  We expect the taping will only take 20 
minutes or so.

Again, your comments will help make this video fun and informative.  Thanks 
for your participation.

Kisses, not music, makes cooking a more enjoyable experience.

I told you I have a long email address.

I've decided what to prepare for dinner tomorrow.  I hope you aren't
expecting anything extravagant because my culinary skills haven't been
put to use in a while.  My only request is that your stereo works.  Music
makes cooking a more enjoyable experience.

Watch the debate if you are home tonight.  I want a report tomorrow...

sure, stop by and we'll arrange a place to meet.  If you come by  during 
trading hours though, I can only say hi for a couple seconds.

That sounds fine. Would you like to meet at your office and go from there?
By the way, I will be in your office earlier in the afternoon for a meeting.

I want to pass on my sincere appreciation for the excellent work and 
assistance from Colleen Koenig during last weeks crisis management program in 
Venezuela.  Colleen was more than helpful and provided services that I found 
invaluable.  She was extremely well liked by the senior management of Vengas 
and spent a great deal of time with them in creating an environment conducive 
to teamwork and productivity.  Her language skills, knowledge and personality 
provided an incredible resource.  Thanks for allowing my program her services 
and I look forward to working with her again in the future.

Jim Rountree

A couple of issues:

1.  I'm having trouble setting a syncopated basis child of a syncopated basis 
child (grandchild).  Is this not currently allowed by the system?

2.   I have a lot of counterparties whom click on hub gas daily when they 
meant to trade nymex.  Although I would like the nymex filter to bring gas 
dailies, is there anyway to separate them a little more clearly.  Eventually 
I would like to run all my products in parallel with gas daily, but I'm 
restricted right now by issue #1.

pira's certainly got the whole market wound up.  I've seen a wave of producer 
selling for the first time in two months over the past two days.  Most 
selling Cal 1 off the back of Pira.  Pira certainly commands a lot of respect 
these days.  Too much, probably.
The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in 
natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March 
and run out of gas.  The spread game is very different than playing crude.  
These spreads haven't moved for the past 1000 point runup.  You know there 
were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven't made 
a penny.  
Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?  That seems hard to believe.

cmon give me some credit-you think ive been doing this this long w/out know
who's doing what! im i ny for the pira conference-thyre pretty bearish cal 01
and 02-will be interesting to see if/when the producers start to take that to
heart. here's one for you to think about... of pira's rite-ie production gonna
be up 1-1.5 bcf by year end. does increased deliverabilty mean these winter
sprds in producing areas-ie jan-apr and the fact the mkts gonna be more
concerened about running out in march than in jan suggest big invererese will
not be sustainable but will happen only on a weather event??? be curoius your

Hey Buster John,

Despite the X's you received last night for your ill behavior, I wanted to 
thank you for dinner because I had a great time.  Although, I do take 
personal offense to being flipped off at least 5 times in the course of 
dinner. Watch your manners when your with a lady!

I hope you have a great Friday and today is one of your top 5 too!

Jennifer, I'm not so territorial that fire hydrants and trees are on my 
priority list, but I thought that I was doing my job OK on this.  If I read 
Crowder's FWD to Kim in a certain "tone", it appears to me that they feel I 
am overstepping.  I'm sure there is a better way for me to coordinate and 
facilitate these meetings, and do so in such a "tone" that Jim doesn't react 
the way I sense he did,  so I'll be coming to you to discuss, OK? 

On a lighter note (I hope), I hope your NY trip went well, and I'll see you 
tomorrow!

Mission/Purpose:  Coordinate EBS Executive Calendars 
for EBS' trip to Avaya HQ in Basking Ridge, NJ

This is targeted as a one-day trip for the Enron executives
Daily objectives highlighted in red, further below.  

Individual items per person follow immediately:

Jim, 

I have spoken w/Nancy Young, and we have penciled in 
that you could possibly make the trip on December 19th, 
20th, or 21st; OR January 9th, 10th, or 11th.  If Larry and Everett 
can also join on one of the same days you are penciled in 
for, I would like to book your time for the meeting.

Larry,

I have left you a voicemail, and this note.  Please let me 
know ASAP which of the days that I have penciled in for 
Jim Crowder's attendance would also work for you.

Everett,

I have called Marie Thibaut and left her the information on 
her voicemail.  Since she's out, I'll send this to you directly, 
as well.  Will you also let me know which days (above) 
work best for you?

Steve Pearlman, 

You and I have spoken, I have your availability info.  Thank you.  


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To clarify the purpose of the Avaya trip:  the first day (only) 
is for executives to investigate the following items --
1)  what value can EBS deliver to Avaya for Avaya internal 
use (product/service solutions, financing, etc.)  EBS sell 
EBS' solutions to Avaya for Avaya internal use
2)  ideas for opportunities for Avaya and EBS to enter into 
a "sell through/sell with" arrangement, whereby some type 
of joint marketing efforts could be enjoined.  EBS sell with, 
and/or through the Avaya sales organization


The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS 
development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the:   
1) results of the executive meetings' output from 1&2 above, 
discuss output of day 1 meetings, & technical issues 
and opportunities
and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which 
could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions 
 to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya's sales & 
marketing team.  Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both 
days due to the nature of his mission.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please let me know as soon as you can which day or 
days would work best for you to make the trip.  I need to 
get things coordinated with my counterpart at Avaya so 
he can schedule his executives' time, and their briefing 
center facility.

Thank you,

Jeff

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the 
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't 
have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be 
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being 
possible alternates...

Thank you,

Jeff

Jeff,

I'm in the process of booking the Avaya Briefing Center and need to know how
many people from Enron will be visiting our headquarters.  I've asked for
the afternoon of December 13th and all day on the 14th.

George,

Happy to work for the greater good, but would welcome your help in nailing a 
deal with Continental quickly, as my understanding is that they have been 
unresponsive to date. 

Thanks

We have a number of key initiatives in process with Continental including 
sales of broadband services, weather derivatives and facility management that 
have the potential to exceed the savings being offered by British Airways.  I 
would prefer that we stay the course with Continental plus I am confident 
that Continental can either meet or exceed BA's current offer.

George,

Enron Europe has negotiated a preferred supplier agreement with British 
Airways which will save us circa $3m a year vs Continental Airlines. I know 
there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me 
know if this causes you a problem. Colin Bailey is in Houston next week if 
you need or want to know any of the detail.

Yea, problem is I left at noon to catch my flight, but Marc had a later 
flight because NY is closer to Columbus than here. Right after I left, the 
market got very busy and Marc decided to stay at work and not go.  So that 
sucked.

John,

Thank you for your flexibility regarding the asian option we purchased from 
you (average Feb-Aug GD HH settle).  Unfortunately, our customer would like 
to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily 
is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) 
- so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your 
offer.

Regards,
Gary

I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average 
of prices, 5 per week.

Subject: SMUD deal Asian options

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

George,

Happy to work for the greater good, but would welcome your help in nailing a 
deal with Continental quickly, as my understanding is that they have been 
unresponsive to date. 

Thanks

Fernley:

We have a number of key initiatives in process with Continental including 
sales of broadband services, weather derivatives and facility management that 
have the potential to exceed the savings being offered by British Airways.  I 
would prefer that we stay the course with Continental plus I am confident 
that Continental can either meet or exceed BA's current offer.

George,

Enron Europe has negotiated a preferred supplier agreement with British 
Airways which will save us circa $3m a year vs Continental Airlines. I know 
there are existing and potential links with Continental, so please let me 
know if this causes you a problem. Colin Bailey is in Houston next week if 
you need or want to know any of the detail.

Regards

Fernley

John & Mike,

Could you please fill out the attach spreadsheet COB today?  There is one 
swap term and one collar term.

It looks like we are getting close to a finance deal and are working with 
John Thompson in the finance group.  The outline quotes would be a buy out of 
existing deals on Enron's books.


Thanks,

Sheetal

Hi, 

I was hoping that you could give me a few minutes after trading hours to help 
me substantiate the EOL commercial.  ABC is threatening not to run it if I 
don't prove that "Enron has created the First Internet Global Commodities 
Market."  I can easily prove we are the largest, but I'm having a hard time 
with first.  I know we were, but I have to have it in writing.

Give me a call or email me and let me know when you have a second or two. 
Thanks, Margaret

I was long 4000 X @ 4902, then I switched it from X to F at the same price.  
I switched it at 5000, but it puts me into the F at a price basis of 4902.

I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average

Subject: SMUD deal Asian options

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly 
identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I 
would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's 
happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the 
LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, 
the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I 
still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals 
and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  
The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  
It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Dear Mr. Arnold,

 It was nice to meet you yesterday at the
information session.  Thank you for the dinner last night.
I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in
a more relaxed setting.

 During out conversation yesterday, I was confused
about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of
your time on the phone with Traders in New York.  When
you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards
Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron
Online?  I think the underlying question that I am asking,
is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,
or is it meant to bypass traders completely.

Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward
to talking with you again when you come to campus for
interviews.

Cordially,

Adam

We spend a tremendous amount of resources and money collecting information.  
Further, the flow we see gives us an advantage in the market.   We have 
little interest in distributing this info outside of the building.  I hope 
you understand.   Good luck to your brother.

Subject: options information

I run the structuring group at Azurix, but I am emailing you in reference to 
my brother-in-law, Scott Adams, who is based in New York City.  Since 
graduating from Brown University he has traded options on the floor in New 
York as a local for the last 8 years.  He trades natural gas options and is 
looking to occassionally do an information exchange with someone where he can 
discuss the OTC market versus what he sees going on in the ring.  If this 
would be of interest or not let me know and I will hook you two up.  Thanks 
for your time.

Let me know when will be good for both you and John on next Wednesday
afternoon. Right now only you and myself have been added into the NT group.
After the demo, if both of you think it is a great tool, then I am going to
add all traders into the NT group, so they can use it.

We are still on for drinks on the 19th.  You have called the market very well 
since you started sending me updates.  Unfortunately for both of us, a couple 
of good calls does not a soothsayer make.  Thus, keep sending me your updates 
so I can at least get a little broader judgment of your abilities.   In terms 
of my trading style, I take positions to make $.25-$1, not $.05.  Too much 
noise in this market to trade differently for me.

I hope you know I was just fishing for a reaction on the phone before.  I
assumed we would discuss a potential relationship when I'm in Houston on the
19th.  We're still on for drinks after work, right?  By then, you should
have a comfort level with the quality of my work.  I think the analysis I've
given you has been quite accurate as to market turns and price behavior.  It
would be helpful if I had some idea of how you trade/view the market.  Are
you mainly day-trading or do you hold positions for several days/weeks?
That way I can structure my comments in order to best serve your interests.
Let me know.  Thanks,

John:

The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing. My
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural
appears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is  poor,
particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The  market
appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If  we
are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be
extremely  bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so
great.   Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger picture
is still  very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of
what I would  call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move
to the  upside.

Let me know if this stuff is useful for you. I certainly  don't want to
waste your time. In addition, if you prefer I call when I  have something
to pass along, let me know. I don't know how often you  check/see your
e-mail. Thanks,

Mark Sagel

Jeff,

Per our conversation this morning, I will list the items in question.  I am
also forwarding this to Kelli Wallin in our accounting department to follow
up on as well.

* ACCOUNTING:  Please see that all service charges were posted as 18%,
per contract
* JEFF: I will fax you the comp ticket showing the 1 hour reception
posted to The Woodlands House account.
* ACCOUNTING: Please fax Jeff the back up for the package handling
charges. $451.35
* ACCOUNTING: Please adjust (1) wireless mouse charge for a total of
$156.41
* JEFF: In regards to the lunch charges, we charged a day guest rate
to include lunch in The Woodlands Dining Room @ $57.00 for  40 day
attendees.  You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package.  However,
when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box
lunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf.  Thus, 80+40=120 - 100
(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The
Woodlands Dining Room.  We billed you for the total amount of persons over
the 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.
* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms.  Enron had a guarantee of
120 attendees.  We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees.  This particular
day, (5) breakouts were ordered.  The audio visual in the additional
breakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.
Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.

Jeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as
possible in order to remit for payment.  Please feel free to call me should
you have further questions.  Thank you for your business!

Credit lines are like bandwidth.  Create the capacity and we'll find a way to 
use it.

John - Enron maxed out its facility with ABN on 9/18/00.  I am going for an 
increase to $50 million.  Do you see increasing your trade flow?  I do not 
want to ask for interest free money if Enron will not use it.

John:
?
The price behavior of the past couple days has been  disappointing.? My 
short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price  rally and natural 
appears to be waning at present.? Volume on this rally is  poor, particularly 
since yesterday was a decent day to the upside.? The  market appears to be 
using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels.? If  we are at these same 
price levels in another two weeks, that would be extremely  bullish.? Right 
here, the risk/reward to being long is not so great.?  Recommend a neutral 
stance short-term on natural.? Bigger picture is still  very bullish.? 
However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of what I would  call horizontal 
price action to set the stage for a big move to the  upside.
?
Let me know if this stuff is useful for you.? I certainly  don't want to 
waste your time.? In addition, if you prefer I call when I  have something to 
pass along, let me know.? I don't know how often you  check/see your e-mail.? 
Thanks,
?

Russell:
I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.  Bill 
Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.  He is an 
extremely creative individual.  Whalley actually commented on him today as 
someone "who thinks outside the box".  Bill actually sat in a bar four years 
and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.  He has been 
successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.  
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.  He throws out 
ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.  He pointed 
out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally 
don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for 
Enron.  In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within 
reason.  I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be 
considered a high priority.  I am willing to accept some of the credit risk 
exposure as a cost of doing business.  Bill understands his role as an 
independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for 
someone with finite capital.  I place very high confidence in Bill not 
conducting high risk trades.  Having said that, we certainly need to monitor 
his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.  Just understand that he is 
at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade 
counterparty.

I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread 
option he traded.  He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the 
trading desk, knew it as well.  There are a couple isolated products that 
Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.  This 
was one product.  Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing 
models created by the research group.  The problem with these models is that 
they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental 
price limitations.  For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, 
for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within 
variable cost than the models predict.  Thus it is necessary to apply a 
correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.  Obviously, 
we have this function in our pricing models.  I was not aware this 
methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.  This has since 
been changed.  Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very 
few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.  

Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to 
Enron.  I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting 
credit.  I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade 
considering the circumstances.  If you believe differently, please advise.
Thanks,

Just an update: Today I set up a front month fixed price gas daily product 
priced at parity to NYMEX.  I thought the response was tremendous.  It really 
shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the 
predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.  

One problem I had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.  I set up a new 
product for the prompt that was Nov GD/D Henry Hub that was a syncopated 
basis of 0/0 to the Nov Nymex.  However, since Dec Nymex is a syncopated 
basis to Nov Nymex, I could not set up a syncopated basis link around the Dec 
Nymex.  Any ideas?Message-ID: <16572848.1075857574744.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

John, John, John....very impressive analysis!  The first two commercials were 
supposed to be idealistic spots announcing Enron as an innovative company, 
while the next four are proof points to our innovation by showing the 
businesses we have created. 

I know you were elated to get an email from me this morning, thus proving 
that I had not been kidnapped and all those important things I work on would 
continue to be completed.  Oh and that certainly is a pretty design you add 
to your emails.  Very masculine!

I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL, 
bandwidth).  The metal man was definitely at a different philosophical level 
than where my brain operates.  Still not quite sure what was going on there.  
Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different 
than previous.   But I guess you know that and that's the point.   Again, I 
think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very 
impressive.  Just telling people we are innovative made less of an impact.  

Sorry I ruined your run.  At least you weren't molested by the River Oaks car 
thief.

Hey JA:
I was at PIRA today and got a preview of their presenation on Oct 11-12 for  
their client seminars.
(Greg Shuttlesworth)
Summary:
They have turned a little bearish becuase
They believe that distillates will cap gas ( get some to graph HO, CL, NY 
No.6 1% and TZ6 Index  and NX3) the picture is very convincing
Supply is increasing at a faster pace (1Bcf/d more in Q4 and expect 
incremental 2 BCF/d next summer)
Canadian production is increasing
Deep water GOm is increasing
Lastly, Shallow water GOM is also improving after years of decline

Demand
modest in 01/02
more efficient gas turbine
economic moderation

Near term
Yes it looks a little ugly this winter
Possibility of shocks in the shoulder ( low storage and early summer heat in 
Apr-May 01)

Call me or write if you call for more details. I am also faxing you their 
fuel substitution slide---- it looks at up to 5 BCF/d being put back into the 
supply chain.


Thanks

Jim:
I apologize for the comment after your order.  I knew you didn't like the 
market last night so I was surprised when you were an buyer this morning.  
It's not your style to change views quickly as you tend to trade with a 
longer term view.   I was out of line with the comment and it won't happen 
again.

John, John, John....very impressive analysis!  The first two commercials were 
supposed to be idealistic spots announcing Enron as an innovative company, 
while the next four are proof points to our innovation by showing the 
businesses we have created. 

I know you were elated to get an email from me this morning, thus proving 
that I had not been kidnapped and all those important things I work on would 
continue to be completed.  Oh and that certainly is a pretty design you add 
to your emails.  Very masculine!  

Smile, Margaret

ps, i hope you can read my sarcasm over email -- if you knew me better, you 
would understand it completely since it is rare that i'm in a totally serious

I really liked the commercials about specifics (i.e.  weather, EOL,

Ode was a bit too idealistic.   The campaign in general was very different

think the commercials that showed why we are the most innovative were very

Dear George,

I hope all is going well for you there.  I need your help.  Listed below is
an email from my contact person at Enron Media Services.  They are planning
to offer media in a trading environment (like a commodity) and need to know
who the "right" contact at SPE would be.  As you can see, they have met with
several people but are unsure who makes the media decisions at SPE.  Can you
please help me direct them to the right person?  If they have already met
with the right person, can you identify them so that I can follow up and
determine SPE's interest in their proposal.  Thanks for the help.

Sean,
The following are the contacts that have been made by Enron Media Services
with Enron Picture. The initial meeting, Enron Media Services was
represented by Mike Horning, Edward Ondarza and Steve Crumley.
We met with the following personnel from SPE:

- Allan Dick, VP Corporate Procurement
- Cherie Crane, SVP Media
- Joseph Foley, SVP Marketing
- Kathleen Shane, VP Finance
- Jennie Angelos, Director Business Planning
- Peter LaBrida, Manager Corporate Procurement

Mike has provided Allan with today's one-year fixed price swap for spot TV
media in NY, LA and Houston.  Mike expects feedback from Allan today on the
pricing and the Sony attendees from meeting.  The next meeting that Mike is
having is
11/1 with Allan Dick.

Could you do some investigation and find out what the feel is for the Enron
Media Services product offering and possible communicate to Sony Pictures
that there are revenue opportunities for Sony also.

Please give me a call when you have an opportunity.

Jennifer

I'm not sure what is happening on my position.  It may have to do with how 
you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so 
dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could 
produce that effect.  
The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into 
the winter.

Subject: Stress Test

The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested.  Under the 
$7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price 
curves proportionally shifted.  Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the 
price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX 
volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.


Key findings include:
$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%  
$9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% 

       

It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the 
financial desk actually decreased.  This would seem to imply that up to the 
seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces 
risk).  But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that 
the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and 
increasing VaR by 74%.  Does this make sense or is something else happening?

Frank

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best
part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends
in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City
on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to
be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??
I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

Jeff Shankman gave me your name.  I have assumed Jeff's old responsibilities 
as head of the natural gas derivatives trading group.  Our broker, EDF MAN, 
supplies us with $50 million of margin financing every night.  They are 
trying to clean up their books for end of quarter and/or year on Sep 30.  
They have asked if we can post the $50 million overnight on the 30th.  We did 
this last year as well.   Please advise,

John:
?
I wish I had a lot to pass along, but not much has changed on  my work.? All 
the analysis is still very bullish and expecting higher  levels.? I am 
receiving hourly "9" type strength patterns, which means the  up move must 
consistently continue from here.? Any drop under today's lows  is a negative 
for natural.? On my daily work, natural will see a new type  of strength 
pattern today.? It is not a "9" type topping pattern, but one  that normally 
comes out along the way as price moves higher.? This would  suggest a 
potential short-term high over the next 2-3 days, but nothing of major  
importance.
?
I have tentative plans to be in Houston on Thursday, October  19.? Are you 
interested in meeting so that I may show in much greater  detail what the 
work is doing and how it can enhance your activity?? Let me  know if that day 
works for you.? Thanks,
?

Hi:
The big money making floor?   I don't think I like that.  Too much 
pressure...what happens if we screw up?

I went to the website and clicked on the link but all I got was a mess of 
characteres and symbols.  Any ideas how I fix it?

on the 'big money making' floor.

Have a good one, Margaret

Jennifer,
After the Universal-Enron conference call with Elyse Kalmans and Misha 
Siegel, we discovered the following:

The majority of the JPI is for-profit and therefore Community Relations 
cannot be a sponsoring party.
Elyse recommended I contact Mark Palmer to discuss the sponsorship and the 
value tied to EMS, Weather, Plastics & Credit.
Universal was hesitant to comment on dollar amounts for the sponsorship but 
noted $250K would be the lowest amount for the JPI Virtual Institute. 

I wanted to consult your advice as to what tactics would be best at this 
point.  Is Mark Palmer definitely the correct contact?  Would you prefer to 
contact him on this front?  

Thanks.

John:   John Nowlan, Dave Botchlett, Jim Goughray and several others met with 
Mario last week.  They were all favorably impressed.   Jeff Shankman had 
asked to meet with him, and their appointment is scheduled for Thursday, 
9/28, at 1:30 pm.   Jeff had also asked that you spend some time with him so 
that a decision could be made as to whether or not to make him an offer.    
Would you have some time available on Thursday afternoon to see Mario?

Thanks,
Molly

The Fortune article is about grassroots change within a company.   It is
written about the lady who started EOL, but I'm in it a little.   Chief of
natural gas derivatives...I'm not really sure what that means.  I run the
Nymex book now but not the floor..just the derivatives desk of five people.

I'm actually going to Costa Rica tomorrow morn thru Monday.   Never been
but heard it's beautiful.  Next time you're in we'll go out.

What do you mean?  I'm serious!

So what Fortune article?  I only saw you in Time...  Pretty freaky to see
someone you know like that!  What the heck is a "chief" of natural gas
derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best
part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends
in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City
on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to
be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??
I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

Please outline the Vulcan contract for Jeff and Jennifer.  They also have 
development questions as to their market capability of metals.  Please call 
Lenard at Vulcan and see what is the type, grade and volumes they purchase.  
We may be able to provide additional leverage to their purchases.

Jeff,
Please investigate this company and see if there  are additional Enron 
products and services like metals that might be of interest.  They are a 
pretty small gas user but there might be greater prospects in other areas.  
What is the value of the contract that we have entered with them?

Thx for the spreadsheet.   2 questions : What time frame does this entail and 
does the correlation between the trader and AGG GAS include that trader's 
contribution to the floor's P&L.  In other words, is my P&L correlated with 
the floor or is it correlated to the rest of the floor absent me?

Dave:
A couple things about the limit orders:

1:  When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open 
should default to 12 hours.  We want the orders open as long as possible.  
Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.  
Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading 
session unless specified otherwise.  

2.  Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.  
When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 
increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).  I could not overwrite the 
quantity to be 15,000.  

3.  Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system 
saying error trade, price not available.

4.  Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, 
without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?  If not, this would be a 
valuable feature.

Thx,

I spoke to Alfred Pennisi from MG today.  MG clears their own trades and 
maybe some for other customers.  He indicated that his cost for clearing is 
$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing 
ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher 
clearing rate and getting access to financing.  This is a question I hope 
your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.  

Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El 
Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long 
futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin 
costs.   Message-ID: <14754729.1075857575601.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Craig,

It will be interesting to see what volumes of metal they 
purchase/use...especially steel, given my meeting results from yesterday's 
meeting w/Tim Battaglia and Art Bieser of Enron Industrial Markets (Steel 
Industry origination).  Heidi, thank you for helping us out!

I look forward to working with your team  on this.

Thank you,

Dear all interested volunteer tutors,

There will be an informational meeting on Tuesday September 19th at
5:30pm. This will be a brief meeting to discuss the tutor program and to
match tutors with students in subject areas. The meeting will be here at
the Houston Ballet Academy in the large conference room.

So far we have students who will need tutors in the subjects of:
art, sociology, spanish, geometry, english, earth science, history
(government and world history), women's literature, and algebra II.

Please let me know if you will be able to attend the meeting, as well as
what subject area that you would like to tutor in. If you will not be
able to attend the meeting, but are still interested in being a tutor
please let me know as soon as possible.

The Houston Ballet is located at 1921 W. Bell. The Houston Ballet
Academy faces W. Grey and is inbetween Waugh and Shepherd (next to
Kroger). If you need specific directions please call 713.523.6300. You
may reach me at 713.535.3205 or email me at:
SCrumbling@houstonballet.org If you have any questions please do not

Hello Vandy Recruiting Team,

Well it is almost time for the corporate presentation on campus (September

either of these events.  We only need two participants for the golf 
tournament but we will need at least 6 to 8 members for the presentation.  
Reserve your spot now before its too late!

JA;
Six months ago we spoke about Tony moving to a commercial role. He followed 
your advice and has gained some experience in structuring. He approached me 
about joining the middle marketing group. I think he would an asset. I think 
we would bring him as an associate with the hope that he would move up to 
manager in 6 months.

Please let me know your thoughts. I would like to use you as a reference with 
Fred and Craig.
Thanks

Meeting Minutes: Bristol Babcock, Pagosa Energy/Well Master, EBS, and GSS
Meeting Purpose:  Business overview, solutions identification/brainstorming
Date: 12/1/00

EBS Attendee:
Anthony Gilmore
Global Strategic Sourcing Attendee: 
Jeff Youngflesh

Bristol Babcock
Kevin Finnan
Jim Griffeth

Pagosa Energy/Well Master
Rob Bender


DISCUSSION POINTS:

1)  Bristol and Well Master feel that there is significant opportunity, with 
placement of enough BBI TeleFlow devices (integrated flow computer, 
corrector, recorder and controller/RTU) in North America that the data 
transmission needs would generate enough bandwidth demand that it would be of 
interest to EBS to provide some of its solutions to Bristol & Pagosa Energy 
"unified solutions" (quotes are mine - JKY) for the gas industry.  NOTE:  
this could take a longer term to reach the necessary "critical status", due 
to the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlow 
generates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.
1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by sales 
of product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS network 
capacity.  (a "sell-through" effect for EBS)

2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutions 
to Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption that 
a near-term solutions engagement would be desirable.  NOTE:  this could 
accelerate to the necessary "critical status", bringing to EBS more solutions 
demand due to the addition of "sell-to".  The "sell-through" effect would be 
present with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (a 
sales "channel"), as well as EBS "sell-to" BBI & Pagosa for their own 
internal consumption of bandwidth.
____________________________________________________________________


ACTION ITEMS:  
1)  Bristol will provide Anthony (Tony) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Services 
the necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI's 
(Bristol's parent co.) Info/Technology area.

2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there would 
be value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability to 
execute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gas 
well-head).

3) EBS (Tony Gilmore) will begin working on the I/T discovery process, 
attempting to aggregate total Bandwidth demand: (usage patterns/volume/etc.) 
at Bristol and/or Pagosa.
3a)  Per Rob Bender, Tony Gilmore should be contacting Al Freimeyer (sp?) at 
Pagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches from 
well-to-vendor.  Rob provided Tony Al's telephone number on 12/1.

4)  Enron GSS to contact Ron Smith - waterSCADA.com - to investigate parallel 
opportunity (gas / water analog).

5)  EBS and BBI/Pagosa will begin (internal efforts) to figure out ways of 
getting the TeleFlow CDPD data onto the EBS "Enron Intelligent Network"

Next Meeting: TBD

Please let me know if I've missed anything.

Dear Jeff:

It was a pleasure meeting with you last Friday with Jim Griffith and
Kevin Finnan of Bristol Babcock.  Perhaps by now you have had an
opportunity to review the  http://wells.pagosaenergy.com web site and
look at aspects of the "demo" section.  This is a very dynamic program
with changes, upgrades, and customization taking place all the time to
meet the individual needs of our customers.

There may well be a good fit here as we are seeking ever faster means of
communication and will be requiring a substantial infrastructure not
only for communications but for data base hosting as well.  While yet in
its infancy we have received very positive feedback and interest from
numerous oil and gas companies in the industry.  An alliance with Enron
to help us on the road to becoming the "Microsoft" of oil and gas well
automation would be a very alluring prospect.  I would like to keep a
dialog going between us to scope out areas of mutual benefit for our two
companies where such an alliance would make sense.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
Rob Bender,
President - PagosaEnergy.com

out of date.
This is the first message to confirm the current address I have for you is

Please reply confirming you recieved it.
A second message will follow to try and replace some of the address's I know
I have lost.
Thanks for your help

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

You have been requested to provide feedback for a participant attending
the next program.  Your input (i.e., a Self assessment, Manager assessment,

action plan to improve his/her management styles and practices.

It is important that you complete this assessment

Since the feedback is such an important part of the program, the participant
will be asked to cancel his/her attendance if not enough feedback is
received.  Therefore, your feedback is critical.

Good afternoon! I hope everyone had an excellent holiday.  Now, it is
time to prepare for the next. Oh, boy, I am glad that stairmaster is
still working!

As follow-up to our 11-11-00 conference call, Clint Beard provided an
update to Ms. Hunter via telephone today.  The update referenced the
lawsuit avoidance between FedEx and a division of Enron.  Per Ms.
Hunter, she feels satisfied with what information FedEx provided.  A
follow-up conference call is scheduled for December 11, 2000 at 10 a.m.
Complete agenda, attendees and phone number will be announced at a later
date.

Bob,

Thank you for your reply.  I know you are doubly busy with your being on the 
road this week, just prior to a vacation.  Your answer below is perfect!  
Bob, you and your team have been very supportive of our efforts to assist EBS 
with BMC, and you have done all that we could have asked!  I wanted you to 
know that we really appreciate your support (I especially do, as a "late 
arrival" to this situation)!  Thank you again for all of the help!

Jeff

Jeff,

Assuming that either Randy or Doug were to decide that BMC was a viable 
solution for their areas of responsibility, we would certainly support 
purchasing the appropriate products from BMC.

Subject: Update

Bob, 

I understand from Thais that you're on the road for Enron, but soon you'll be 
"on the road for Bob" - a well-deserved vacation coming up!  In light of your 
impending vacation, I wanted to do a quick follow-up check.

If we could somehow, without causing an undesirable state in your 
organization, facilitate the ability to purchase BMC solution product for Net 
Works, would you support that?

I have spoken with Bruce Smith, Randy Matson, and Doug Cummins in followup 
calls from the November 17th meeting in EB 22C1.  IF Randy and Doug were 
likely to make a pro-BMC decision (instead of for a competitor's product), 
and IF there was a way to painlessly (for Net Works) enable the funds to 
become available to make a purchase of BMC product (by Net Works), would that 
be something you would support?  I am searching for a way to help EBS without 
impacting Net Works in any negative way...but ultimately, I will abide 
whatever you demand here.  

I hope to hear from you, either by telephone/voicemail, or e-mail; if you 
could do so prior to your vacation.

Thank you again for your help,

Jeff Youngflesh

Subject: data standards


Dear AEDC Member,

One of the most interesting developments in the economic development arena
is the creation of the AEDC/CUED/EDAC Site Selection Data Standard.  This
standard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economic
developers and their customers to have one common means of presenting and
examining data.  Adoption of the standard promises real time savings and
more effective economic development decisions as communities will be more
comparable than ever before.

A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it to
see how the data standards can be made to work for you.  There are 25
tables in the standard presented in an excel format.  The tabs at the
bottom of the page will access the additional tables.

You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can use
the services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered into
a strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary for
the standards.  ACN will provide data and provide future updates of the
standard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to which
approach works best for you.

Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economic
development profession.  They should be of particular advantage to the many
areas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven't
received the consideration they deserve.  The standards are a great way to
tell their story.

If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look for
notices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on the
standards and their use.

derivatives?!  Skilling's old job?

Check out the Amazon (AMZN) chat on Yahoo... I was joking that all of my
friends were in the press lately (i.e. YOU, as well as all my HBS buddies),
so the guys on the trading floor thought this would be funny.  The best part
is that someone thought they were serious and started in on the
conversation!!  I do investor relations for a hedge fund in Dallas, so
that's why they are talking about my IR/selling skills... but it's not
exactly your typical corporate IR position considering our investor base.

I'm going to be in your neck of the woods tomorrow.  I'm visiting friends in
Houston on Friday & Saturday, then going to my sister's house in Bay City on
Sat. night.  No firm plans, just getting out of Dallas.  Are you going to be
around?

I thought about you the night after I saw the article because I was in
Snuffers, drinking a strawberry daiquiri...    =)  do you remember why??   I
think about that every time I go there....

Take care and make money!

Details of Nitrogen Pressures and volumes.    For a new scheme we would want  
100 psi, to suit the nitrogen ring main. Current supply pressures from BOC 
are not relevant. Volume is 28-29,000 rm3/hr at Wilton and total of approx 
45,900rm3/hr when the other  sites are included.   This issue of supply to 
the other sites could be a problem as BOC are physically entrenched in the 
piped supply arrangements.

Subject: Meeting to discuss 2001 direct expense plan

Hi John,

Since Jeff has left I am assuming that you will be responsible for the plan 
for your cost center - 105894.  Please correct me if I am wrong.

I have scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 4pm with you to discuss the 2001 
direct expense plan for Financial Gas trading.  I will have a schedule that 
details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and 
a template for the 2001 plan.  

I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you 
tomorrow:

1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?  If so, what level of person?
2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?
3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?
4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want 
to plan for?
5) Are you expecting any promotions?
6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement 
agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?
7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?
8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should 
plan for?  If so, how much and where?
9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, 
monitors and software?
10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should 
plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)

My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished 
before Paula Harris took over.  She will be coming to the meeting with me.  
Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the 
meeting.

Thanks!
Suzanne

Mary Cook is working on t he brokerage agreement between Fimat and Enron.  
That should be done in about a week.

Hey John,

We'd briefly spoken on the phone last week, but I haven't been able to come 
by and talk to you like I'd promised.  Louise had mentioned you did not like 
Cynthia Kase's newsletter and may not want us to put Cynthia's weekly 
summaries on EnronOnline.

Since Fred (Lagrasta) and his group think publishing her summaries on 
EnronOnline will attract more of the smaller customers, would you have any 
objection over us publishing the Kase newsletters.

Pls. let me know ASAP so we can proceed with this further.

Regds.,
Rahil

Lavorato wanted me to check on the $5,000,000 VAR extension.  Is it possible 
to get this extended indefinitely until the west basis market settles down?  
We will have a good percentage of the west position rolling off over the next 
week as well as indices get published.  Please advise ASAP.

Just some feedback on our EOL discussion.  Whalley had similar thoughts about 
how to address the ICE issue.  His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we 
post 1/8 on ICE.  If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server 
automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.  If someone betters that to 2 bid, we 
immediately go 2.25 bid.  So we are always the best market on ICE so long as 
it is not inside our EOL 2-way.  Thus the only way our best market shows on 
ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market 
gets shown.  If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was 
that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which 
system you like better.

Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will 
be implemented shortly.

I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing 
a product this week.  The purpose will be to communicate about the importance 
of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 
2-ways and killing the broker markets.  Message-ID: <24051747.1075857576623.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Subject: Long Term Volatility

John, Mike,

As you may know I recently moved from the Calgary office to the London 
office. The vol curve here is marked very similarly to the Nymex curve at the 
front but drops off to a much lower level at the back. Richard Lewis, who is 
in charge of UK Gas and Power trading, would like to discuss the rationale 
behind the longer end of the NG curves, both vol and price.

Could we all get on the phone sometime next week (Monday is a holiday here) 
perhaps before the open or shortly after the close? (The Nymex closes at 8pm 
UK time.)

Thanks,

Dave

I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.   If El Paso, absent this 
power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their WACC 
in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ENE, is that transaction a 
mark-to-market gain for us?  If not, what's the difference in paying them 
with an asset rather than cash.  If it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a 
way to generate false P&L?

Subject: ENA Fileplan Project

Ina, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project:

We are records and information management consultants from Millican & 
Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to 
formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're 
taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic  inventory of each 
ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually 
a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain 
this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask 
that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our 
working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with 
their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff.

There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. 
Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic 
records--much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. 
Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention 
requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, 
once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility 
for it, and how long it must be maintained.

Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an 
imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and 
then use the "imaged" document viewable from your computer as the working 
copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to 
offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. 

During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic 
records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. 
MSA, SAP, etc.. The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we 
do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an 
interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions.

 If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.  
Thank you.

Ali,

The "Bridge" you referred to in your voice message to me is not the one you 
want, I believe.  You referred to a $5MM spend by Enron w/ "Bridge".  That 
spend data comes from the pre-SAP era, and may not be as accurate as one 
might hope.  In addition, you will find that the product/service category is 
"Hardware".  I am not sure that is the "Bridge" which Kathy Shaps is looking 
for the contract information (if any) on.  

That Bridge (Kathy's target, I believe) is the one which EBS has done a deal 
with (Bridge/Savvis/EBS, early summer '00; for WebFN)...Jeannette Busse & 
Greg Reynolds are intimately familiar with that customer relationship, but 
perhaps not at the contract level.  If it is and EBS-only relationship, EBS 
may have the only contract.  The EBS contracts contact would be Ray Stelly, 
who reports to Pat Weatherspoon (Ray is out until Monday the 11th, though).  
You might also check with Richard Weeks, who could direct you to the right 
person in EBS purchasing, if it's a "buy on PO" situation.

http://www.bridge.com/

http://www.webfn.com/cgi-bin/core.dll?i9=267&s144=index.txt&sfront=1&slogin=0&
sframeBust=undefined

Please check the URLs above, and if they take you to the company with the 
"Enron relationship" you're referring to, I'll have a better idea what to 
look for.  In the meantime, I am looking into our contracts area to see what, 
if any, contracts that GSS has active (for any part of Enron) with any 
company called "Bridge", whether it is Bridge Information Systems, or some 
other "Bridge".  When I have more information, I'll call and/or e-mail you 
with an update.  I'll also copy Kathy and Kim.

Thank you,

Jeff

Due to VAR reasons, you and I  both need to sell today.  Vol and price are 
going up, implying Enron can carry fewer contracts today than Friday.  Have

Mr. Dyson:

Jennifer Medcalf asked me to forward to you the following brief overview of 
Enron's relationship with Continental.  Please feel free to contact Tracy 
Ramsey directly at #(713)-646-8311 with any further questions regarding 
Enron's buy side relationship  with Continental.   Ramsey is the Global 
Strategic Sourcing, Portfolio Leader, who manages the Continental 
relationship.

Enron Buy Side with Continental:

Current Enron US spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately $40 
million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.  

Enron Sell Side with Continental:

Additionally, Enron has a strong relationship with Continental's Fuel 
Management company.  Specifically, Enron has been hedging Continental's crude 
oil over the past 2+ years.  Value to Enron has been over $9 million; value 
to Continental has been over $45 million since 1999.  Enron Global Markets is 
currently exploring several other business propositions with Continental 
Airlines in the following areas of financial risk management:  weather 
derivatives, plastics hedging, and on-line jet swaps.  Enron Energy Services 
is exploring an energy (electric commodity) deal with Continental as well.

Mr. Dyson, please don't hesitate to call if I can be of further assistance 
regarding these sell side opportunities.

The roll out for phase II EOL is (for now) 8/28/00. Options are qeued next 
after that. Unfortu ately I wish I could give you a hard date, but it is out 
of my hands and in Jay Webb's shop. I am pushing as hard as I can but Louise

I don't know what else to say. The application is built, it just needs to be

Subject: Reuters Story on E-Exchange


By Fiona O'Brien
   LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The head of the largest yet Internet
exchange for energy products said it will combine traditional anonymity
with transparency to give traders a better overview of market activity.
   The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based venture
initiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August
24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to go
live soon afterwards.
   While market transparency will increase as dealers used to
over-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, users
of the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, Jeffrey
Sprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.
   "As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals both
counterparties," he said. "The real strength is that you (still) get the
ability to manage your own counterparties.
   "You can list all of the people you want to do business with and put
in the credit terms under which you will do business."
   This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a
"giant matrix" within the system.
   "(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't sure
they have ever seen the entire market," he said.
   "(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals you
can't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market."
   Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currently
aware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase market
transparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers who
fall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.
   The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clock
and will be accessible via the public internet or a private network
connection.
   Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco
<BPA.L>, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>, Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter <MWD.N>, Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS><SHEL.L>, Societe Generale
<SOGN.PA> and TotalfinaElf <TOTF.PA>.
   Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operation
and Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominant
internationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.
   Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and power
companies, American Electric Power <AEP.N,> Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy
<UCU.N,> Duke Energy <DUK.N,> El Paso Energy <EPG.N>, Reliant Energy
<REI.N> and Southern Company Energy Marketing <SO.N>.
   Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact that
the founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and will
face additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment to
trade a minimum volume.

   TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING
   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believes
trading over the Internet could boost trading profits.
"The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that a
paperless back office can really save a lot of money," he said.
   However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off given
that dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearing
systems, as they do in current OTC systems.
   Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties will
receive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through those
players' own risk management systems.
   But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its own
clearing system.
  "No one really knows how at the moment," Sprecher said. "There might
be some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now exists
peer to peer."
  In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurred
except those associated with trading. Membership is open to any
commercial market participant.
   Each product will have its own published commission schedule, which
Sprecher assessed at "slightly below the best prices someone would pay
in the voice broker business".  ((London newsroom +44 20 7542 7930)

Although I would prefer to see the counterparty name for failed transactions, 
it is not of great importance and I certainly understand a third party system 
not supplying us with that info.

John,

As you are probably aware we did a click through deal with Houston Street, 
whereby EOL prices would be posted on their platform. The initial thought was 
that this would be transparent to the trading desks; they wouldn't care 
whether the trade came from Houston Street, True Quote or EOL (although we 
could make the platform name available to you if you so desired.) This still 
will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to 
reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed 
transaction. I don't know whether this is an issue for you or not, but I 
would like to know. We will probably run into this issue with any platform we 
deal with for obvious anonymity reasons. I would really appreciate your 
thoughts/concerns.

Subject: Sydney Olympics & IDRC


Planning to attend the Olympics in Sydney, Australia?

Here is a networking opportunity for our international IDRC visitors to 
experience some warm Aussie hospitality.

The Sydney Chapter would love to offer our international IDRC members an 
opportunity to combine the Olympics with a real Aussie Bush Barbeque in one 
of our National Parks close to Sydney.

The Chapter has set aside Thursday, 14 September 2000 for an IDRC 
International "Wine & Wisdom" event in the form of a Bush BBQ.  The time is 
4:00 - 6:00 pm for a BBQ, a little informal information sharing, and some 
warm Aussie hospitality.

Just let us know who you are, how we can contact you, your particular social 
or business interest, and we will be in touch with more detail.  It's then up 
to you!

Contact John Fox, IDRC Australia Regional Director, tel (612) 9977 0732, 
email: john.fox@idrc.org

Regards,

Bruce Richards
Australia Regional Council Chair

Hello:
There is one feature that has not been transferred to the new stack manager.  
When I sort by both counterparty and product at the bottom of the screen, the 
position summary does not sort by both product and counterparty, just by 
product.  It would be very useful if you can replace this. 
Thanks,

That is fine...Just make sure you ensure the confidentiality of the floor is 
not compromised.  Do not let him see any EOL entry screens.

Hope the London trip is going well!  Thanks for the suggestion below which 
was perfect.  Mr. Thompson called yesterday to confirm that he would be 
working with me to schedule a conference call with the two Kinko's contacts 
early next week.  I'm glad I came in last Friday to send out those e-mails to 
him.

Thanks again for the suggestion.

Sarah-Joy,
I would hold this info and let Mr. Thompson determine if he needs more info.  
He will get back to you for clarification if he has a hard time.  You can 
also use this information when Mr. Thompson tells you who is the right person 
you can verify by asking questions from the information below.

Jennifer:

Mike Rabon had just forwarded to me this helpful synopsis of the opportunity 
with Kinko's as he sees it.  I would like to forward this on to James 
Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and 
cc Mike Rabon).  Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it 
overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention "Gary 
King" Mike Rabon's Kinko's contact in the e-mail?

Thanks for your suggestion!  SJ




Mr. Thompson:

Here are several "touchpoints" identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband 
Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate 
broadband solutions architect at Kinko's.  You may recall having met Mike 
Rabon in the October 6th meeting. 

Kinko's has an IP network today with access to all branches.  Kinko's had 
expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to 
it in the spring 2001 time frame.  Enron's goal would be to make a needs 
assessment for the desired structure that Kinko's would like to see as it 
pertains to:
Near term network planning.
IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.
IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet 
transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit 
capacity.
Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for 
managed storage. Enron's solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy 
storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko's about 
your storage strategy and growth.
Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the 
actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the 
hubs.
Interactive Video - Enron's IPNet Connect product will allow high quality 
H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron 
IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be 
significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality.  Enron's 
utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic 
and video traffic to traverse the same network.  Mike Rabon would like to 
speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.
Risk Management - Enron's expertise in Risk Management needs to be 
communicated to the proper person.

FYI. I spoke with Steve. Seems like they have not been successful with plan 
A, i.e. to get their investors to give them authority to trade OTC as well as 
futures. They have moved on to plan B which is to take one of their domestic 
funds (approx. $500mm under mgt) off the floor (futures only) and into OTC 
trading. Still has the rating problem with Enron, but I am trying to get him 
to arrange a conference call with their CFO so I can discuss ways around it. 
He will try to do so this week. Mind you, I left it at this point the last 
time I spoke with him a couple of months ago and it seemed to stall. I'll 
keep chasing it.  Per

Frank:
One of the most likely scenarios for a VAR blowout would be a severe cold 
front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.  In 
such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how 
Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures 
were $200.  The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, 
and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position 
currently.  But in the winter that may change.
Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the 
assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.  Assuming we enter 
the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long 
cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side.   
While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the 
payout probabilities may look like the following:

20%  $ -.05
40%     $ -.02
20% $ 0
19% $ .03
1% $ 1

Subject: Stress Testing

RAC is working on developing some "canned" stress tests regarding VaR.  For 
example, one test could be called "hurricane", were the prompt month is 
"stressed" on both price and vols, holding all other inputs constant. 

Anyway, I would like to know of any likely/realistic stress scenarios you can 
think of....

Let me know,

Subject: VaR Methodology Change

Gentlemen,

Below is a plan of action for moving along with the VaR methodology change 
related to forward-forward volatility:

1. Finalize the methodology proposed (Research/Market Risk)

 - determine the time period used to calculated forward-forward vols vs. 
correlations (20 days vs. 60 days)
 - stabilize the calculation for curves and time periods where the curve does 
not change based on historical prices, implying volatility of 0%

2. Get approval for the methodology change from Rick Buy (see draft of the 
memo attached) - John Lavorato and John Sherriff



3. Develop and implement the new methodology in a stage environment 
(Research/IT)

4. Test the new methodology (Market Risk, Traders)

5. Migrate into production (Research/IT)

Please let me know if this is reasonable and meets everyone's expectations. 
Vlady.

Jennifer,
I had forgotten to invite Roy, but I did tell him about the meeting, and he 
was OK w/getting the notes after the fact.  I also told him I would not 
forget to keep him in the loop and invited to any future meetings.

As for Ron Smith, I really have egg on my face.  I totally forgot about Ron 
(I was thinking only Instromet, and S-J was running with that).  I think that 
in my excitement and effort to get this meeting put together, I overlooked a 
few important details.  I will certainly do a better job next time!

Thanks for the reminder!

JY
p.s. I was unable to get w/George during the day yesterday, but I did catch 
him at about 6:35pm.  I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities 
(Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).  He gave me some good feedback, 
and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.  The only thing 
I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on 
feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do 
the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW 
felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I 
can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this 
case.  But next time, there won't be a next time - so that won't be an issue 
anyway!

By the version of EOL do you mean the new version of stack manager ? If you 
do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out 
today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that 
might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some 
serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign 
whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many 
things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, 
obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we 
thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should 
discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.

If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, 
we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august.

any questions please feel free to call.

Please a flat amount.  Don't hold me to pins.  Everyone is giving a flat

The list I gave you is a list of brokers that can clear through you, NOT 
brokers that you clear exclusively.  You do not clear any of my brokers 
exclusively.  All trades that clear through you will be done on discretionary 
trade-by trade basis.  You MUST have your floor personnel reverse everything 
they they told my brokers this morning.

I am not happy.

Interesting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus 
opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the 
winter.  A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection 
season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those 
projections seem to be closer to 2.7.  With supply of gas very inelastic to 
price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the 
equation.  The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand 
(mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies 
will be stored rather than burned.  Each AGA number is another data point as 
to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a 
comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number 
indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.  
Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number  may be 
a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting 
noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand 
equilibrium.  We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.  
If we get two low injections, watch out.

Subject: Market Opinion about AGA's


	

John,
I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.  In the 
beginning of the season, AGA's were  very important in framing the bull 
case.  The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under 
stored.  I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change 
that expectation. 

However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of 
bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.

At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come 
from the physical market and weather. 

I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.

Thanks,
Frank

Just following up on two topics.
One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,500,00 despite the fact 
his P&L is never close to that.  Can you check that his exotics book 
positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.

Second:  Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer 
term Vol problem until we change formulas?

Company Press Release
SOURCE: El Paso Energy Corporation
El Paso Energy Corporation Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings Per Share
HOUSTON, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Energy Corporation (NYSE: EPG
<http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=epg&d=t> - news </n/e/epg.html>) today
announced second quarter 2000 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.69,
an increase of 73 percent over second quarter 1999 adjusted diluted earnings
per share of $0.40. The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per share
of one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstanding
for the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjusted
earnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the second
quarter increased by 55 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 million
in the year-ago period.
EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in the
quarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.
``Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance in
our other non-regulated segments produced these record results,'' said
William A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso Energy
Corporation. ``Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolio
of flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued to
accelerate in the second quarter.''
For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per share
increased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the first
six months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excluding
non-recurring items, increased 55 percent to $798 million compared with $515
million in the year-ago period.
Second Quarter Business Segment Results
The Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in the
second quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last year
and $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gas
and power portfolio developed over the past several years is creating
significant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhanced
trading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesale
customer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company's
off-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributed
to the record second-quarter performance.
The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBIT
to $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higher
realized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following the
reorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices for
the quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and
$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, from
the year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per day
and oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.
The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,
nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was due
primarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together with
the acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March
2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillion
Btu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.
Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural Gas
Transmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million compared
with an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of cost
savings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 11.3
TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlement
filed in March.
The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 million
compared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects in
Brazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company's
investment in the Philippines.
Telecom Update
``We have made substantial progress in the development of our
telecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,'' said William A.
Wise. ``Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,
we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso Merchant
Energy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in building
businesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our Merchant
Energy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in the
telecommunications marketplace.''
Quarterly Dividend
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share on
the company's outstanding common stock. The dividend will be payable October
2, 2000 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September
1, 2000. There were 237,786,853 outstanding shares of common stock entitled
to receive dividends as of June 30, 2000.
With over $19 billion in assets, El Paso Energy Corporation provides
comprehensive energy solutions through its strategic business units:
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Southern
Natural Gas Company, El Paso Merchant Energy Company, El Paso Energy
International Company, El Paso Field Services Company, and El Paso
Production Company. The company owns North America's largest natural gas
pipeline system, both in terms of throughput and miles of pipeline, and has
operations in natural gas transmission, merchant energy services, power
generation, international project development, gas gathering and processing,
and gas and oil production. On May 5, the stockholders of both El Paso
Energy and The Coastal Corporation overwhelmingly voted in favor of merging
the two organizations. The combined company will have assets of $35 billion
and be one of the world's leading integrated energy companies. The merger is
expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, concurrent with the
completion of regulatory reviews. Visit El Paso Energy's web site at

    (a) Adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents diluted
earnings
        per share before the impact of certain non-recurring charges.
Second
        quarter 2000 results exclude merger related charges of $(46) million
        pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.  Second quarter 1999 results
        exclude merger related charges of  $(131) million pretax, or
        $(86) million aftertax, a gain on sale of assets of $19 million
        pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the resolution of regulatory
        issues of $30 million pretax, or $20 million aftertax.  Year-to-date
        2000 results exclude the extraordinary gain on the sale of the East
        Tennessee and Sea Robin systems of $89 million aftertax and merger
        related charges of $(46) million pretax, or $(31) million aftertax.
        Year-to-date 1999 results exclude the cumulative effect of an
        accounting change of $(13) million aftertax, merger related charges
of
        $(135) million pretax, or $(86) million aftertax, ceiling test
charges
        of $(352) million pretax, or $(222) million aftertax, a gain on sale
        of assets of $19 million pretax, or $12 million aftertax, and the
        resolution of regulatory issues of $30 million pretax, or $19
million
        aftertax.
    (b) Proforma diluted loss per common share reflects reported diluted
        earnings per share but assumes dilution.  Reported diluted loss per
        common share does not assume dilution because dilution would reduce
        the amount of loss per share.

I spoke to Vlady this afternoon regarding the alternative VAR methodologies.  
I think changing to a Riskmetrics historical VAR system is more defendable 
and objective, will provide more consistent results, and will create more 
realistic results.  I understand Vince has a similar opinion.

Subject: Forward-forward Vol

John,

Per your and Jeff's request, Research and Market Risk Groups have conducted 
an extensive analysis of the forward-forward vol methodology used in the 
Value-at-Risk calculation. 

We analyzed and compared two methodologies: 

 the existing methodology - based on forward (implied) vols
 an alternative methodology - based on historical vols

I would like to schedule about 30 minutes to walk you through the pros and 
cons of each methodology and get your input.

Vlady.

Hello,
Bill Perkins of Small Ventures USA is having a party this Saturday at the 
Mercantile bar downtown.  He has rented out the place, has a band, open 
bar...  usually pretty fun.  He asked me to give both of you an invite in 
appreciation of the work you've done for him.   If you have interest, ccmail 
me with whether you need one or two invites each.

Jeff,

The value that we are looking for is the annual spend from ENA (trading 
floor) to have each trader access the Bridge Information System or Bridge 
Terminal.  We believe that Enron would get this backbone connectivity from 
Savvis.   This information is supplied by Bridge and has nothing to do with 
the WebFN transaction done by EBS.   Any thoughts on where we can find the 
annunal spend by ENA to gain access to the Bridge Terminals and their 
information - we thought that GSS might have the annual spend numbers.   

thanks for your help,

Kim Message-ID: <9423570.1075857578729.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Hey Liz,
Thanks for letting me use the phone.  A real life-saver.

My brother had a Nokia world phone on the trip and it seemed to work 
better.   It got reception some places where mine did not and is more 
user-friendly.

On a different topic...Greg talked me into upgrading to first class for a 
flight in December to Australia.  He talked me into it by agreeing to pay for 
half.   Cliff found it funny and agreed to pay for the other half.  I haven't 
expensed it yet so I'm having Barbara send it on.    
Thanks,
John

Dave:
A couple of issues:

1.  We continue to have a number of transactions that fail because of credit 
exposure.  These are companies that have excellent credit, such as Duke, 
Dynegy, Equitable, Mieco, etc, but have a fixed credit line on EOL that they 
blow through periodically.  They get a failed trade and it often takes 5-10 
minutes to rectify the problem, at which time we've lost the trade.   We need 
the major counterparties to have unlimited credit on EOL, just as they have 
in normal trading.

2.  As a corrallary, I am under the impression that when a trade fails 
because of credit, the counterparty does not get an explanatory error message 
describing what happened and what to do.  When a credit failure happens, the 
counterparty will often keep clicking on the same product, getting the same 
error messageMessage-ID: <18295626.1075849625294.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Jennifer,
Due to the Vivendi merger, the Universal deal has taken on a whole new 
scope.  On a lead from Jeff Y., I contacted Kim Monk, Dr. Corp. Alliances, 
who reports to Nebergall.  Kim was interested in discussing this further and 
working on best leveraging BU strategies.  We are to catch up when she 
returns to Houston, but this is what we discussed in our quick phone call 
today:

Vivendi 
Enron delivered an MOU to Vivendi (Kim may forward)
Currently 5-6 initiatives including:
Vivendi overall - bandwidth, co-location, dark fiber, PAN European network, 
cable 
Havas (Viviendi subsidiary) - discussions with Havas CEO for distance 
learning, bandwidth, ASP and streaming initiatives
Initiatives in other subsidiaries including:  Canal Plus, Digitel

Blockbuster
Due to restructuring of Vivendi/Universal, EBS to work on Blockbuster's 
year-end (Phase I) initiatives first and then (Phase II & III) 3Q next year
Cox speaking with Universal in LA as content and distribution partner 
(although this is Blockbuster's obligation, Enron is also working as a third 
party to secure)

Enron-Vivendi Relationship
Vivendi sees Enron as both a competitor and partner depending upon the segmentMessage-ID: <14479698.1075857578945.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Subject: Re: using new FF vols  

Hi, John,
following up the discussion with you on Friday we talked with Risk Control 
people who are not excited to use that FF vol curve
you sent to me. Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them 
for all the locations.
The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol 
curves from historical data.
I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price 
curves for NG and 
all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.
I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers 
based on these curves:

     5/30/00  5/31/00
AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000  4,516,000
AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)  2,858,543  3,011,761
AGG-GAS        (production) 36,627,200  40,725,685
AGG-GAS       (test, 0.97)  29,439,969  31,207,225

You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. 
I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which 
would give more weight to recent data.
We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect 
backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.

Tanya.

The focus is on Jim Schwieger's  storage book as of 5/25 and 5/26
where we had some counterintuitive results. This book is a good
candidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.

It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR 
system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative 
basis,
jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.
This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a 
big
jump in VaR.
This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, look
at column D.

The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors:

 a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the
                     code to review it.

 b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in
                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can 
propose, is to develop for
                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to 
review the fwd vol curve
                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  
it can be smoothed.

Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?


Vince

Remember we were trying to figure out the difference in return between tax 
free investment growth and annually-taxed investment growth?  Turns out that 
it is different, but over 5 years and a 10% growth rate, it doesn't amount to 
much more than the cost of our beer tab.  See attached.

To "Outstanding" Analysts and Associates:
I  am writing to inform of a possible opening on the natural gas derivatives 
trading desk.  It is an opportunity to work on one of the most profitable and 
demanding groups within Enron, as well as one of the largest financial 
commodity trading desks worldwide.  I envision the role as performing 
analysis initially, to grasp an understanding of gas fundamentals and become 
more familiar with the trading environment, and leading to a junior trading 
role.  Upside potential is limitless for the right person.

Candidates for the role need to possess the following qualities:
1. Have been ranked as outstanding on previous yearend reviews.
2. Excellent math and quantitative skills.  Candidates should have 700+ math 
SAT and/or 700+ GMAT
3. Basic understanding of economics including pricing differences under 
monopolistic and competitive market scenarios.
4. Ability to work under intense pressure.  

If you are interested please email with interest and attach a resume.  Do not 
call.

Come by Tuesday between 5:00-5:30 if you still want to see the new

runs my risk, as he built the system and understands the vertical integration 
better.

Sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the LNG deal on Friday; I was a bit 
confused by the question. 
In terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done.  Market 
conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.  
Obviously, a deal this size would require Enron to wear a considerable amount 
of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very 
favorable.
I am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level.

The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on 
the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.  
Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all 
strikes.  If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, 
making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 
cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller 
size than most people want to trade.  If we restrict to strikes with a lower 
delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a 
market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the 
money.  
Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way 
wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.  Thus if the front swap on EOL is 
4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 
3.75/4.75, 100 up.  In this case I think 100 is necessary because once a 
strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.  Thus I anticipate 
having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.

In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles 
struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for 
what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying 
to rip people off.  Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier 
for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more 
sense.  It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.  Whereas if 
someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to 
call ENE to close the trade.  If the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a 
market on both the 3100 call and put at all times.  Secondly, I would 
anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just 
the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.Message-ID: <3736625.1075857579361.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Just a couple of quick items that need to be addressed.  First, what happens 
if the delta of the option is greater than the size of the hedge offered on 
EOL?  Second, what strike are straddles traded at.  Are they set at the 
nearest 5 cent interval or are they mid-market of the EOL quote?Message-ID: <6821010.1075849625341.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

The increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to 
two factors.  First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics 
book due to the nature of the position.  I am currently using the ltx to hold 
longer-term strategic positions.  The large increase in position is a 
reflection of my view of the market. 
Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was 
transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until 
this morning.  Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's 
position and a corresponding decrease occurred today.

Subject: Option Analysis on NG Price Book

John,

Several months ago we talked about the development of an option analysis tool 
that could be used to stress test positions under various scenarios as a 
supplement to our V@R analysis.  We have recently completed the project and 
would like to solicit your feedback on the report results.

We have selected your NG price position for April 4, 2000 (POST-ID  753650) 
for the initial analysis.  Attached in the excel file below you will find:

Analysis across the various forward months in your position 

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Summary of your Overall Position analysis

Underlying vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L 
Volatility vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L
Time change vs. Greeks, theoretical P&L


Multiple Stress Analysis

The attached Word document demonstrates the multiple stress choices.  I have 
included a tab in the excel file that demonstrates the theoretical P/L 
resulting from shifts in both volatility and underlying price.  


Please note that the percentage changes across the column headers are not in 
absolute terms (for example, if the ATM volatility in a given month is 40% 
and the stress is -10% then the analysis is performed under a volatility 
scenario of 36%)









Thanks,

Rudi

This past weekend we released a new version  of the EOL software that, 
unfortunately, had a bug.  The effect was to lengthen the time delay between 
numbers changing and when they would show up on the internet to an 
unacceptable level that increased the number of failed trades.  We made the 
decision to take some of the more volatile products temporarily offline until 
the fix could be made.  I do not anticipate this to be a concern going 
forward.  Thanks for the feedback.

I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better 
replicate seasonal fundamentals.  There are convincing arguments as to why 
the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.  However, in the previous 
methodology they blew out.  For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 
while Cal 10 was .256.  
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the 
summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months 
of July and August over time.

The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for 
the month as well as for the year.  These premiums are as follows:

Jan  -.008
Feb -.004
Mar -.001
Apr .002
May .003
Jun .004
Jul .004
Aug .004
Sep .003
Oct .002
Nov -.003
Dec -.006


These premiums start in Jan 2004
On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 
4/5 spread was marked at .0475.  
In the old methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965
Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044


In the new methodology
Jan 2003  = 2.959
Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885
Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028

The only change in the formula is from:
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table
to
Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month 
premium table

The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I 
change themMessage-ID: <11467315.1075857579741.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Mr. Nowlan:

When we spoke several days ago, I had mentioned the meeting between Jeff 
Shankman and Larry Kellner, CFO, at Continental Airlines.  The meeting had 
been scheduled for December 11th, 2-3 PM in EB 3321.  I will know tomorrow if 
this date is confirmed.  Following our phone conversation, I did follow up 
with the persons you suggested -- Larry Gagliardi, Douglas Friedman and Mark 
Tawney -- as I completed an overview of our initiatives with Continental.

The meeting on December 11th will enable Enron and Continental to continue 
discussions on three initiatives listed in order of economic value:  (1) fuel 
management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR 
analysis.  

In order to verify attendees at this meeting, Jennifer Burns suggested that I 
follow up with you.  Please note the Continental attendees listed below.  Did 
you want to have the same origination team at the meeting or others?  I look 
forward to your response so I can coordinate with them and confirm their 
attendance.  Continental had requested that we keep the Enron attendance to 3 
or 4 persons; they will do the same.

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)


We appreciate your suggestions.
Thank-you.

Dabhol lenders to vote today on PPA PPPPA termination
Our Banking Bureau Mumbai

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. "In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the 
Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president 
and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying. 
Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of 
the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the 
construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to 
be invested in unit Elektro, it said.
"There are no clear regulations for the sector. Regulatory issues are holding 
back investments," JB Online quoted Gonzales as saying.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia." 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
"more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further." 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices." 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com. 
NGX located in Calgary, Canada provides electronic trading and clearing 
services to natural gas buyers and sellers at seven markets in Canada. Over

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)
2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)

     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell
Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be
insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.
     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by
keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''
U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,
Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.
     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said
Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.
     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,
agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a
utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific
Resources of Reno, Nevada.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power
prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's
collapse.
     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset
portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer who
recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined to
comment on a potential bid by Oregon.
     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press
reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,
the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland
General.
     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more
than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added
Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about
market power,'' he said.

                            Bond Issue

     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using
the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state
might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale
because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that
slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.
     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by
utilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power
plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of
the Portland General purchase.
     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this
year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-
earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California
homes for an hour.
     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31
percent this year.
     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9
pence to 492 ($7) in London.



Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)
2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)

Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing
information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million
($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.
     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a
unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,
changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include
trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating
gas-price indexes.
     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in
calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron
spokesman Eric Thode said.
     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90
percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline
to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the
cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.
     Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.Message-ID: <23188656.1075857602755.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Jennifer asked me to explain about the effect of the refinery fire.

The St. Croix refinery has their reformer offline.  The reformer is used to 
convert straight-run naphtha into a high octane blending component called 
reformate as well as some butane and lighter gases.  The effect would not 
really be a reduction in gasoline, but a reduction in a high quality blending 
component which would make it harder to make RFG.

As of this writing, the fire is out. If you have any further questions, feel 
free to contact me.

Hawk vote for California firm unanimous 
Montgomery Watson pegged for water plant 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The Houston Area Water Corp. voted unanimously Monday to grant a $92 million 
contract to a California-based firm to design, build and operate a Lake 
Houston water plant. 
City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The 
administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery 
Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron 
Corp. 
The water corporation, known as "the Hawk," voted 5-0 to grant the contract. 
If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years 
to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. 
It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 
million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. 
The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, 
and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. 
The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 
when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to 
construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant 
expansion for $32 million. 
But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. 
The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a 
short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds 
itself. 
The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay 
the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant 
eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This 
plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could 
cost about $2 billion to implement. 
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure 
committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would 
focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three 
recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. 
Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and 
that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee 
this contract. 
The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. "In 
my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who 
will do it," Robinson said. 
The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been 
heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. 
Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new 
pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating 
Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council 
members to switch the contract to it. 
Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten 
work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the 
Hawk procedures as well. 
John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the 
first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman 
David Berg complaining of the "deleterious economic effect" on Azurix of the 
board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg 
answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the 
job. Berg didn't do so. 
Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of 
Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply 
indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. 
Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. 


		

		
		
		
		INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project 
Financial Times; May 15, 2001
By ROBIN ALLEN

		There are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or 
sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export 
scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. 
		Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is 
reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in 
which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. 
		However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of 
"selling" at least part of its shareholding. 
		The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit 
from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. 
		The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the 
United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu 
Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic 
political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a 
large-scale project, especially in the early stages. 
		Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu 
Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer 
on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to 
exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific 
North Field to Abu Dhabi. 
		Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron
's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to 
construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. 
		Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but 
one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas 
accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin 
Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. 
		"If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable" for western energy 
majors, asked one senior western diplomat, "then why are the serious US 
energy majors not involved?" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy

JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
"If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD 
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per 
year," Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.
Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that 
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy 
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. 
But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates. 
A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. 
Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market. 
Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998. 
These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. 
"The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California," 
Kean said. 
North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. 
In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. 
However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.

Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday. 
The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000.
However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies. 
"What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization 
in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable 
power supply significantly," said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the 
University of Tokyo. 
Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users. 
"There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly 
implement the liberalization," Hatta said. 
He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized. "If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity." 
Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. 
(ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward 
trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization. 
Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called "Reassessing Power 
Deregulation," which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. 

Hatta of the University of Tokyo said "it's very wise" that Japan has begun 
the deregulation with the "bilateral supply, or trade" system under which 
suppliers and users clinch deals directly. 
Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial 
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - 
is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial 
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. 
Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and 
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power 
providers, Hatta said. 
Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation 
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates 
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs 
are levied on prices. 
"There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices" nationwide, 
Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees 
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. 
Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) 
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. 
Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power 
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its 
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with "strong back-up" from the 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. 
"Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with 
power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select 
independent power providers," Omuro said.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.
By Cameron Dueck

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy 
giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign 
investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and 
bankers say. 
But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.
The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from 
country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity 
across Asia, they say. 
It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security 
offered by government payment guarantees. 
"Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an 
illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging 
market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be 
adversely affected because of it," said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP 
Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. 
Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion 
power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. 
MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by 
Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. 
The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the 
$48.2 million outstanding. 
The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to 
MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said 
Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. 
Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal 
governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. 
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES 
Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk 
before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital 
expenditure. 
Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. 
Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or 
even changes in market conditions. 
But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts 
said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient 
enough to back these agreements. 
Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in 
emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they 
said. 
"Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're 
even more so," said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in 
Singapore. 
"If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad." 
Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more 
pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy 
away from emerging Asian nations. 
"Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a 
properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to 
call in a government guarantee," Booth said.

Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is 
expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its 
choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas 
projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. 
The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee 
overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't 
completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers.
"Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some 
time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with 
recommendations from the technical committee," the sources said, according to 
the newspaper. 
However, the oil council "might endorse some balances concerning the offers," 
the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. 
Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be 
notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas 
projects. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement. 
After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil 
companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each 
project. 
The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar 
Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil 
Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E). 
For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, 
Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were 
shortlisted. 
And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were 
shortlisted.

MSEB refutes allegations by Enron, DPC
Girish Kuber

MUMBAI 
THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron 
refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the 
political force majeure.
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political 
force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil 
its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond 
its control. 
MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political 
circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. 
"Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related 
security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our 
rights'," DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was 
uncalled for. 
For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events 
occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. 
MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. 
The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, 
which had been subjected to "concerted, deliberate and politically motivated 
actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which 
will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform 
obligations under PPA". 
"Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that 
the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for 
providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in 
protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights," the statement added. 
However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 
402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply 
electricity as per the agreement. 
MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 
and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on 
Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. 
MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 
213 crore.

Saudi Supreme Petrol Council meeting to decide on huge gas project bids

RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings 
on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take 
a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. "The SPC has been 
discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and 
the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman 
al-Suhaibani told AFP. 
"It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final 
decision will be issued," added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The 
meetings began two weeks ago.
A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his 
firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. 
"The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were 
told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early 
next week," the executive told AFP. 
The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with 
the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding 
for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. 
The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. 
The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment 
in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in 
the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the 
Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. 
They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the 
world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. 
US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, 
Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been 
shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms 
BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. 
ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. 
The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up 
petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. 
The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out 
simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, 
the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the 
executive said. 
Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the 
current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven 
billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. 
Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has 
proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic 
metres).-AFP

John

Hope you're well.

We are doing some work here on the long term curve for UK natural gas and 
would value your views on the long term NYMEX Nat gas curve.
By long term I am talking 7-20 years. 

Our thinking is that beyond the traded period of 5-10 years forward, UK 
prices would at least partially reflect the long run marginal cost of LNG in 
a "globalised" market provided US prices were not significantly above.

As we are currently working on some long term structured deals it would be 
great to get your input on this. 

Many thanks

Andy

my office.? It's those lilies that they used.? It really is a very pretty 
arrangement.? Thank you so much.

Uncle Elmer & Rosa are not coming this week as they have an illness in the

Jennifer, 

I hope James is getting the treatment he needs to get on the way back to 
normal!

As you can see below from the reply from Serge Minassian's AA, it would 
appear that the note I 
sent to Thad on the 21st hadn't been used to successfully transfer the info 
to Barbara...I will 
now call Kim Godfrey back (I was waiting on this response from Ms. Korp, so I 
could better know 
the Avaya Execs' calendars' status).

I'll talk w/you later...

Jeff,

Thanks for the message and especially for letting me know that the meeting
will not be held on December 13th and 14th.  I already reserved the Avaya
Briefing Center, but will be sure to cancel it this morning.

If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to contact me.

Barbara,

I do not know if you received a "heads-up" on this,
but since you are working with Executive calendars and the
Briefing Center resource, I wanted to make sure you had it.
Better safe than sorry, especially with the recent holidays.

Thad White and I agreed that in order to properly simplify
the communications channels between our organizations,
that he and I should be the primary points of interconnection
for this particular project and these meetings.  I apologize that
I do not have the calendar availability of the various Enron
Broadband Services executives, but given the opportunities
of having meetings in Basking Ridge either:  (for 1.5 days of a
3 day period) December 19 - 21, 2000 or January 9 - 11, 2001;
the (tentative) preference leanings are toward rescheduling
the currently proposed dates of December 13/14 to the
January 2001 dates.

I will keep Thad posted, and he will keep you posted.  I
apologize for any delays or confusion, if any, but I will
periodically check in with you as well, to make sure we're
all on the same path.  My primary communication focus will
be Thad, however, in order to minimize any confusion.

Thank you,

Thad, can you give Barbara a "hold" on this until you and I get the
people scheduled?  I have just returned from a day off, and don't
have the information I needed yet.  It still looks like Jan 8-9 may be
leading date candidates, with the 19/20 or 20/21 of December being
possible alternates...

Barbara, et. al.:

After a flurry of phone calls, in which both Jennifer Stewart
and I have spoken with Serge Minassian, the following dates
look like the most likely targets:  for the 1st day (half-day session),
Wednesday, December 13.  For the 2nd day (full-day session),
Thursday, December 14th.

Serge has indicated his availability for a 2-hour block of time,
on the 13th in the afternoon.  That meeting would be essentially
an executive overview and strategy session for the appropriate
Avaya executives and the Enron Broadband Services exec-
utives.  The bulk of that meeting would be EBS' presentation
of their Value Proposition for the potential EBS/Avaya efforts.

The second day would be for members of Avaya's engineering
and development organizations, and possibly marketing; to
have a full day to meet with the equivalent EBS team.  Both
software/firmware and product platform-type of concepts would
be examined, and any other area in which EBS and Avaya
development folks felt that there were possible synergies for
a solution or solutions for the following 2 primary areas:

1)  "sell to":  EBS solutions to Avaya for internal use, and
2)  "sell through & sell with":  EBS and Avaya possibly
developing a solution for bringing to market in a similar
fashion to the Avaya/Siebel Systems' efforts.

By way of copying this to the EBS team, I am asking that
they will coordinate with me whom they would be sending,
and to make sure that the 13th/14th of December fit into
the appropriate calendars.  If there are any Avaya questions
related to development/engineering efforts, I would coordinate
as well, and most likely route to Larry Ciscon, or other EBS
engineering/development executive(s), as appropriate.

Thank you again for your help, and we look forward to the
opportunity!

Jeff & Thad,

I spoke with Serge this afternoon.  He definitely wants to meet with Enron
as soon as possible, but only for a maximum of two hours.  Two members of
his team will participate, Wayne Sam and Edward Chang.  I will coordinate a
date with them and send a message of available days and times.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to call or write.

Hi Tracy,

On Wednesday of this week we had a visit from Jennifer and Peter, and we 
highlighted a number of problem areas that we are experiencing with Amex 
Travel Management.  They suggested we inform you of the problems, in the hope 
that you would be able to take it to a higher level on our behalf.

Up until a year ago American Express were based on the Wilton Site.  They 
migrated to Newcastle (about 50 miles away)  and  migrated again some six 
months later to Edinburgh ( about 120 miles away).  Each time they have moved 
the level of service we have received has deteriorated.

Some six weeks ago we had a meeting with Lisa McKenzie (Area Manager) from 
the Edinburgh office, at which we detailed our concerns to her.  She said 
that she valued our business and promised to take these concerns away and to 
rectify all problems.  In reality nothing improved, to the extent that we had 
another meeting with George Blues (Account manager)  last week, and informed 
him that we had not seen any changes for the better.  We also told him that 
if things did not improve within the next six weeks, we would consider taking 
our business elsewhere.  We have actually made contact with a local company 
and are using them in conjunction with Amex for the next six weeks.

Typical problems are:-

Communications - trying to contact people in Edinburgh is difficult.  
Response when we do contact them is not forthcoming.  Not being able to speak 
to the same person twice.  Promises of return calls do not materialise.

Invoices - difficulty in resolving disputes.

Car Hire - not negotiating the best deal with regards to rates.  We 
negotiated better rates with Avis ourselves.

Hotel Bookings - not using Enrons preferential rates on hotels with reserved 
rooms.

Rail Travel - lack of detail on tickets.

We feel that they are paying lip service to what we are saying and making 
general excuses in the non performance of their obligations.

We hope you can assist us in getting a better level of service than that 
which we are currently receiving.  

Regards

Lesley

John -

I left a message about this last week, but wanted to follow-up with
additional information for your review.  We have three offerings currently
available (or coming soon) that I feel would compliment the small/mid cap
and fixed income exposure you already have through Redwood, Sequoia, and
Willow.

Quantitative Allocation, LLC: Integrates four quantitative investment models
to drive aggressive (and potentially leveraged) asset allocation decisions.
Generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and
futures transactions.  Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to
-175% of net assets.  This is clearly different from the largely
non-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own.  I would consider this to
be a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund with
a brain and on steroids - call me and I'll explain that comment in more
detail).

Juniper Crossover Fund, LLC: Managed by OrbiMed Advisors, and focused on
global biotech and pharma.  Up to 30% participation in private equity.  This
could be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-class
manager.

Tamarack International Fund, LLC: Long/short stock-picker fund focused on
the international mid-cap market.  I feel this fund is very similar in style
to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the
international markets that you currently lack.  This is a new fund and the
first closing will probably be in June.

Of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not
constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests in
these funds.  Please call me if you're interested in any of the strategies
outlined above, and I'll have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to
you.

As Final Exams Begin, Power Is a Big Question
By JODI WILGOREN

c. 2001 New York Times Company

For final exams, prepared students pack extra pens, calculators, bottled 
water, granola bars. And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus 
this year, a flashlight. 
As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during 
California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 
31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts 
may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.
''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior 
communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. 
''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People 
have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' 
In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. 
Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the 
disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the 
options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a 
Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. 
Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms 
have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have 
sufficient natural light.'' 
The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of 
California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in 
a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in 
February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to 
the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy 
consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison. 
Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside 
campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the 
blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. 
At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress 
levels. 
''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because 
I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a 
sophomore majoring in political science. 
Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to 
grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, 
planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a 
problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. 
''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' 
Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member 
class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on 
the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to 
Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the 
final counts for only 20 percent of the grade. 
That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, 
is hoping for. 
''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my 
air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''

(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)

BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But 
others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company 
announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry 
BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This 
thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans 
as well as making future working capital more expensive. 
The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same 
BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that 
change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market 
prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures 
the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such 
costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, 
whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.
Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the 
whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no 
doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a 
result. 
In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages 
had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to 
cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has 
reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts 
have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. 
The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled 
is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears 
to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too 
much, so prices should fall further. 
The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth 
business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This 
sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the 
resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the 
greater advantage of shareholders.

OUTLOOK
Outlook
Houston needs to think small about future technology
WILLIAM DYLAN POWELL

05/13/2001

(Copyright 2001)

OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook 
readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone 
mentions Houston? 
Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random 
acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While 
Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to 
start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology 
advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.
Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular 
scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power 
numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to 
construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered 
matter. 
Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, 
you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford 
residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The 
possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for 
their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories 
that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a 
patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. 
Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all 
manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the 
environment and from a business process standpoint. 
Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with 
fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a 
functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these 
have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS 
(nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. 
This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect 
Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's 
economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting 
research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, 
still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities 
of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic 
development. 
Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two 
separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; 
and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, 
nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent 
machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much 
technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet 
the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. 
Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister 
to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of 
semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye 
on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated 
$2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And 
a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of 
their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion 
dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its 
own projects, but they receive far less publicity. 
Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice 
University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic 
excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate 
and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting 
technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity 
and support than other less commercially significant disciplines. 
On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will 
converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends 
that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief 
executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue 
of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its 
potential economic impact on the region? 
I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of 
Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound 
benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. 
Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's 
going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while 
Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think 
small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to 
our city and its economic development.

A
Panel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of 
life top group's list of needed improvements

A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation 
as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to 
transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. 
The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated 
with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston 
must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to 
compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever 
they choose.
Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn 
enrich the lives of every Houstonian. 
"The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests 
of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management 
executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. 
A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force 
recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have 
discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 
years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public 
education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and 
current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of 
successors. 
The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role 
in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of 
business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined. 
"Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of 
the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major 
corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of 
Houston," the report states. 
"But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly 
diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter 
how benevolent those leaders might be." 
The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most 
successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned 
Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, 
president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president 
and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the 
Greater Houston Partnership. 
Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group 
is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. 
"They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool 
around with something that is ill-conceived," he said. 
Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who 
advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's 
work could be very influential. 
"This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the 
part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life, 
Klineberg said. 
The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a 
source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier 
business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan 
said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the 
center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. 
Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people 
representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, 
seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various 
guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston 
scenarios. 
James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined 
in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not 
necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, 
they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. 
In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and 
decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop 
participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to 
the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. 
Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air 
standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax 
rate increase. 
Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the 
gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a 
large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year 
hardship post on the way to something more desirable." 
Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system 
by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational 
resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn 
leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in 
the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. 
These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to 
state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school 
graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or 
technical training programs. 
The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they 
would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and 
federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent 
on more traditional educational programs. 
In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's 
reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that 
hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically 
competitive. 
These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable 
city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and 
redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and 
public transport in corridors that delight the eye." 
Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate 
pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range 
of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street 
light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail 
lines extending in various directions. 
To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome 
their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt 
"new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city 
centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the 
expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city." 
Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy." 
The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns 
its energy toward diversifying the economy. 
The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its 
business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology 
and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly 
become significant global players. 
The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements 
of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city 
in which to live and conduct business." 
Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees 
to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such 
as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to 
begin translating these ideas into policy, they said. 
Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce 
results as soon as possible. 
"If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a 
low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway 
said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the 
nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. 
"We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure 
that we educate these kids for our future."

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion

05/13/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.

Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided 
not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete 
construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. 
"It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into 
infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the 
board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the 
phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.
Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General 
Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. 
However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, 
the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the 
completion of the project. 
DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus 
marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. 
DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in 
last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been 
able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity. 
The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 
65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global 
debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC 
after its completion. 
In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity 
shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders.

Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED

05/13/2001
Agence France-Presse
(Copyright 2001)

DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a 
project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East 
Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday. 
Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the 
Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE 
Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between 
Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
"The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is 
being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told 
MEED. 
Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported 
last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for 
constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as 
too high. 
"There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to 
develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. "But whatever 
happens, we are staying." 
On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the 
project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic 
metres) of natural gas per day. 
Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the 
agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was 
inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. 
According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price 
formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following 
"high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi". 
TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar 
project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), 
with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. 
From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to 
Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also 
planned, as part of a regional gas network.

BUSINESS
SMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what 
amounts to limo service on the lake
CAROL RUST
Special to the Chronicle

05/13/2001
Houston Chronicle

KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden 
box he'd made at school. 
"This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago. "When I grow up, I'm 
going to live on a boat."
His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand 
until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure. 
On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter 
yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot 
luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay. 
"This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant 
boats. "The others are here to party, but this is it for me." 
The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against 
the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad 
executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party 
for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered 
among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white 
dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her 
neck. 
In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star 
Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment 
on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. 
Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million 
in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics 
to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked 
down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. 
One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. 
Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as 
regular on-board equipment. 
"It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore." 
Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the 
prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, 
transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The 
galley crew does the final cooking. 
Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its 
size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but 
Lober has hundreds of competitors locally. 
"I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, 
drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things 
you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on 
a boat." 
Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 
30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and 
VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a 
limo does on land. 
Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the 
Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters 
deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can 
seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. 
Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a 
supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in 
Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business 
after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M 
Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. 
But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat 
to providing exclusive entertainment on the water. 
In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of 
vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism 
or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, 
researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take 
to float his idea. 
Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 
passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the 
notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. 
"I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five 
feet deep in places, he said. 
Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. 
"This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober 
said. "They had no confidence. 
"I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank 
and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and 
tell me what it needs,' " he said. 
Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, 
he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a 
charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. 
After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel 
Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 
percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar 
engines on the boat. 
Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving 
drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. 
Clair. 
Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. 
The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but 
it didn't prepare him for marketing. 
"I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent 
$125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that 
he called "a total flop." 
Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as 
long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, 
he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a 
time. 
Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, 
insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave 
once," he said. 
Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he 
got one: target marketing. 
He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the 
boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate 
client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate 
customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy 
Mills mall. 
"We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi 
Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. 
"The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. 
Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back." 
Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star 
Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, 
the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of 
waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still 
undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober 
adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future. 
"We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the 
other boats," he said. 
After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting 
everything back into the business. 
The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate. 
But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers. 
"We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they 
prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said. 
It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector 
screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that 
some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other 
locations on the Houston Ship Channel. 
If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath 
the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor 
causes the player to bounce. 
Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from 
the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star 
Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements 
for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a 
major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's 
stanchions into palm trees. 
And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats 
instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being 
honored at a recent floating awards banquet. 
Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back. 
"They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first 
cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something 
different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they 
usually want to do it again." 
But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered 
boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards 
dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes. 
About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent 
corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company 
has chosen to have with Star Fleet. 
Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that 
Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are. 
"It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he 
said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just 
one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake, 
there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can 
actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor. 
So people have to be reminded." 
He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford 
cruises, Lober said. 
"Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare 
our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, 
country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And 
our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut 
corners." 
Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax 
and gratuities. 
Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his 
crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with 
some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras 
beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks. 
"We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the 
best and give it back to them." 
Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's 
business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make 
their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real 
opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three 
boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers 
moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 
guests. 
But one boat can still do a lot of advertising. 
At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were 
slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star 
Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they 
were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. 
As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge 
under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - 
the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star 
Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. 
It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from 
school years ago, Lober says. 
And he's going to live at the top.

More power to reform agenda
Soma Banerjee

The Economic Times

THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the 
infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose 
of government support. 
Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private 
investments in this sector have failed to take off.
Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about 
Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its 
promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole 
consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy 
sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of 
this key industry. 
Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating 
new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health 
of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power 
plant developers. 
After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit 
only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in 
greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. 
The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection 
are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement 
that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution 
front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs. 
``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they 
are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say. 
But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms 
cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before 
they break even. 
The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if 
the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron 
too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry. 
IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop 
by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it 
difficult for investors to take decisions. 
``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up 
for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for 
eight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project 
is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source. 
According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance 
Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health 
of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs 
have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or 
escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. 
According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now 
responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the 
Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. 
But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield 
much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that 
can help this backbencher.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit Possible
By Himendra Kumar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

05/12/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s 
(ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute 
over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu 
said. 
In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact 
that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power 
price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.
A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with 
representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another 
meeting May 23. 
Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours. 
"I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first 
meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There 
has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the 
meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a 
meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes," 
Prabhu said. 
Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron 
Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly 
maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving 
issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open 
offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract." 
The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity 
from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 
billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. 
A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, 
recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour 
for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. 
The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial 
disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, 
failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is 
working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of 
excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of 
the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. 
The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a 
revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt 
naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron 
has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second 
phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant 
will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. 
Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest 
shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General 
Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.

India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue

05/12/2001

Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 11. OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee 
headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power 
Company. 
Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last 
night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.
Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. 
Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development 
Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders, 
Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting. 
When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are 
coming again on May 23. What does that mean?" 
Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, 
senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the 
State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the 
rebate slapped on DPC. 
"Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by 
DPC to the centre-stage," the official said. "The company has not mentioned a 
single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or 
the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate 
in our letters to DPC," he said. 
Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the 
company would issue the preliminary termination notice. 
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and 
Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their 
stand vis-a-vis Enron. 
They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB 
does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. 
They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is 
learnt. 
MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it 
against the non-performance penalty. 
Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice 
issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that 
DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the 
Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default. 
The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three 
arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept 
the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - 
leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. 
The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to 
the conciliation notice from DPC. 
Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC, 
Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and 
Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC. 
Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and 
Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on 
May 23, Mr Lal said. 
Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and 
telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving 
Dabhol Power Company (DPC). 
The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr 
Harish Salve's candidature for the job. 
The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third 
conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the 
Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable 
conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. 
DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the 
substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three 
weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the 
conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force 
majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the 
project.

India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach

05/12/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.

Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a 
"willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power 
ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol. 
"I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC 
and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same", 
Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday.
He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra 
government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between 
MSEB and DPC. 
When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion 
that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should 
buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity 
and not buying one. 
"There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term 
power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying 
states", he reiterated. 
Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential 
buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same". 
Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the 
latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 
300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be 
commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.

DEFAZIO CALLS FOR STATE TO BUY PGE TO PROTECT RATES

Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's 
motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor 
"I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can 
insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business 
community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale 
markets." -- U.S. REP. PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.
The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General 
Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market, 
U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday. 
Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but 
others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing 
factors. 
Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to 
DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. 
Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio 
said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and 
generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon. 
"I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can 
insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business 
community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale 
markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore. 
PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and 
is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific 
Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible 
buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. 
While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders 
showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea. 
"I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this 
time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already 
has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and 
conservation. 
Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and 
talk with DeFazio. "I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't 
plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state 
government could run a utility as efficiently as a business. 
DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership 
would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway 
corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would 
provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be 
a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back 
into the state's coffers. 
The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. 
DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in 
the realm of possibility." 
DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob 
Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents 
customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE. 
Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the 
utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville 
Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to 
publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to 
buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity 
sales contracts that already are in place. 
And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't 
necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks 
said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned 
utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. 
The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE, 
but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it 
had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly 
owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention 
for DeFazio's potential candidacy. 
"I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose 
schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of 
those," Eachus said. 
DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area 
issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to 
build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with 
his plan.

Congressman suggests state buy PGE
By CHARLES E. BEGGS
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the 
state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. 
The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber, 
who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.
PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 
customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many 
Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets." 
DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and 
have the utility operate as a public power entity. 
He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission 
rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources. 
"While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be 
feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. 
Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. 
Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, 
citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political 
environment in the West. 
Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private 
utility, as long as it would benefit consumers. 
DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public 
ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville 
Power Administration's hydropower. 
The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature. 
"Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons. 
"Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a 
bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue." 
Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large 
businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating 
plants. 
Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the 
Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job 
like a utility purchase.

Saudis Set to Select Firms for Gas Projects

NEW YORK -- After more than two years of talks, Saudi Arabia is about to 
announce its choice of international oil companies for three huge natural-gas 
projects that will mark a reopening of the kingdom's energy sector to Western 
investment, a quarter century after it was nationalized. 
But the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early 
next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for 
the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion. 
It will be months before final agreements are signed.
"We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at 
the end of the year, or, hopefully, the first quarter of next year," said 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi in an interview last week. 
Saudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today 
to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. In the following week, Saudi Arabia 
is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides 
of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects. By the 
end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are 
expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects. This will 
be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter, 
has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest 
reserves of natural gas. 
As with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound. All 
three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group 
and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the 
plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose 
environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas. The Ghawar project, 
known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in 
investment. Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast. The third project is in 
Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a 
southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates. 
The companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or 
who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil, 
Shell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental 
Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum 
Corp. -- to lead each project. But they all have their hopes. 
"We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator" for the 
Shaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive. 
Since Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to 
the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues 
as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration 
and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as 
well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their 
investment. 
Soon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as 
the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals 
company Saudi Basic Industries Corp.

Cheney task force seeks input from interest groups
By SHARON THEIMER
Associated Press Writer

05/14/2001
Associated Press Newswires

WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has 
met with more than 130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions 
often at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private 
sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney. 
The vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force 
have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage 
a free exchange of ideas.
The White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to 
Congress. 
But interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse 
interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist. 
Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants 
such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both 
GOP donors. 
Houston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and 
electricity. 
"The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have 
a huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work 
through our associations to the extent we can," said Don Duncan, vice 
president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co. 
Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included 
about a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and 
staff. 
No details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarized 
the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background 
and proposals. Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their 
priorities. 
At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove 
and Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey, nuclear energy executives tried to 
make sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over 
the past few years. At one point, Rove asked if anyone was looking to build a 
nuclear power plant. An executive with Exelon replied that his company was 
thinking about it, meeting participants said. 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one 
with Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California 
with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done 
little to help the power-strapped state. 
Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's 
power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it 
and possible solutions. 
"They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever 
affecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation," Davis 
spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "I think it demands more attention than a 
one-page memo." 
Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been 
studying the California problem almost daily. 
At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in 
late April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined 
national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals. 
"I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that 
coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when 
the plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help 
martial this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United 
Mineworkers Union. 
White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage 
lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was 
permissible under federal law. 
Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California 
Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca 
Mountain federal nuclear waste site. The vice president plans to meet with 
the renewable-energy industry this week. 
Enron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving 
more than $110,000, and helped sponsor a $7 million party fund-raiser last 
month. 
The Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds 
of its $193,000 in contributions last year. Edison International, whose 
holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a 
major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to 
Democrats. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because the 
power wholesaler is a respected member of the industry, not because it was a 
contributor. Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity 
transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new 
transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he 
said. 
Tom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is "totally ludicrous" to think 
political donations played a role. 
Cheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's 
invitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Cheney spoke about the task 
force process, Kuhn said. He said Cheney's remarks were consistent with the 
vice president's public statements. 
Edison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built, including 
coal, natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power, Kuhn said. 
Democrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings, but 
Cheney's office responded by only listing broad categories and no names. That 
has left fodder for political attack. 
"You can't just take advice from one interest group or set of interest groups 
when you do these things," said Dave Albersworth of the Wilderness Society, 
whose group has met with Lundquist but was denied its request to talk with 
Cheney. 
Weiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from 
more than 130 groups since January in an "almost Herculean effort" to draw 
input from all sides. 
"People deserve the right to petition their government and not expect a full 
laundry list of who's called to be announced," she said. 
Enron spokesman Palmer said he is not seeking such privacy. "I'm happy to 
tell people what we're advocating for. I'd rather be talking about policy 
than about politics," he said.

		COMPANIES & FINANCE UK: Independents drill deep to strike rich seams: A new 
generation of smaller oil companies is emerging; a group that has discovered 
how to be competitive, writes David Buchan: Financial Times; May 14, 2001
By DAVID BUCHAN

		The UK's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number. But they can 
rightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective 
demise are exaggerated. 
		Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed 
"independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing, 
believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating 
in the North Sea 30 years ago. 
		After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo, 
there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left. Yet 
they amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significant 
exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden. 
		Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in 
the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to 
consortia with a local flavour. 
		But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more 
free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the 
same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British 
Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil. Enterprise is the only UK independent 
that is more than a niche or regional player. As such its E&P assets would be 
a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured 
interest in taking it over. 
		As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based 
independents began to look elsewhere. "Unlike US independents which have 
always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those 
in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the 
world", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood. 
		Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in 
the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union. One company, Ramco Energy, 
dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in 
the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m). 
		Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into 
Russia and got stuck. While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because 
it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam 
operations. Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a 
country notorious for non-payment of energy bills. With diplomatic help from 
Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob 
it of its Ukraine assets. 
		Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia. "Cairn Energy 
now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would 
be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest 
foreign player in India," says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg. Premier Oil is now a 
substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and 
Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore. 
		But there are risks in these Asian ties. The obvious political one concerns 
Burma. Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its 
presence was helping the military regime. Premier refused, and said it would 
carry on. 
		The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to 
Cairn. Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are 
"very dependent on the strength of the local economies". But then, Mr Redway 
is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in 
exploration rather than production. He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas 
highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector". 
		Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end. Its 
goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap 
exploration for production assets. "This avoids the expensive development 
stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on". Then at the other end 
of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil 
or Venture Production. Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no 
bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings 
overlooked by the majors. 
		The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil 
price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and 
sellers. 
		But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is 
this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is 
selling off. 
		As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company 
with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not 
exploration. And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort 
Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years. This new 
generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one. 
"Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value," 
says one executive. 
		The other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock 
market. "By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in 
terms of cash flow and earnings," says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance 
director.

marshal this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United 
Mineworkers Union. 
White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage 
lobbying.

QATAR: UAE's Dolphin may seek new partners if Enron exits.
By Kedar Sharma

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DOHA, May 14 (Reuters) - Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) may invite new foreign 
investors to join its project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates 
as U.S. Enron Corp looks set to bow out, industry sources said on Monday. 
"New partners are a possibility," Khaldoun al-Mubarak, project manager for 
DEL, majority owned by the UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), told Reuters.
"But at the moment we are in the midst of finalising the formal (development 
and production sharing) agreement with Qatar which should be done by 
September at the latest." 
Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which 
outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5 
billion project. 
UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by 
France's TotalFinaElf and Enron. 
"Enron is going through major global restructuring," Mubarak said. "(But) 
they haven't officially notified us about their intention to pull out." 
Enron officials declined comment. 
Mubarak said interest in DEL was running high. 
"Everyone is asking for a stake," he said. 
The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North 
Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas. 
UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and 
setting up production facilities. 
The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up 
receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. 
First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or 
early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be 
consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi with the remainder supplied to Dubai.

UAE: UPDATE 1-Saudi expected to name gas race winners on Tuesday.
By Peg Mackey

05/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DUBAI, May 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is 
expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its 
multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with 
the negotiations said on Monday. 
The sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell 
as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's 
upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation 
in 1975.
Signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place 
in early June, the sources said. 
The anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's 
gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its 
energy investment opening over two years ago. 
But the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas 
sector, the world's fourth biggest. "The fiscal regime and regulatory details 
have not been developed," said one source. 
FINAL CUT 
Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential 
foreign investors revealed last summer. Those companies had been grouped 
under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah. 
For ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi 
Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the 
biggest slice of the projects, analysts said. 
Other industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company, 
was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in 
core venture 2 (Red Sea). 
Royal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the 
sources added. 
Both oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the 
kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said. 
ENERGY DRIVERS 
An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's 
landmark energy opening. 
And analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve 
those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low. 
"Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity," a source said. "The 
gas projects will show profits." 
But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and 
electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen. 
On paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for 
impressive growth. 
Domestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is 
forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade. 
Saudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's 
biggest, remains off limits. 
Even so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil, 
the kingdom's lifeblood. 
"The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate 
objective," a regional analyst said. 
"Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually 
they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the 
majors." 
The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the 
kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed 
by gas supplies, such as power and desalination. 
The following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects: 
Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP , 
TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI . 
Core venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron
/Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell. 
Core venture 3 (Shaybah Area) - Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon, 
Conoco, TotalFinaElf, Phillips and Enron/Oxy.

Saudi Oil Council To Meet Tue On Gas Projects -Sources

05/14/2001

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- International oil companies vying for a stake in Saudi 
Arabia's downstream gas projects, expect to be notified soon on whether they 
have been selected to participate, industry sources in the kingdom said 
Monday. 
Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council is set to meet Tuesday and shortly 
after, announce its final selection for each of the three core ventures on 
offer, the sources said.
The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with international oil companies on 
the Gas Initiative, submitted its proposals for consortium members and 
leaders to the country's Ministerial Council in April. These were then passed 
on to the SPC for final approval. 
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who heads the SPC, is in Bahrain Monday 
attending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders' summit along with Saudi 
Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, who heads the gas negotiating 
committee. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement. 
After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the 
past year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project. 
Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron 
Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1, 
the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development. 
For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, 
Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed. 
And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were 
listed. 

With all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and 
essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to 
lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after, 
industry sources said. 
Exxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture. 
The operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be 
responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which 
will lead to final deals probably by year end. 
Also, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's 
individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't 
finalized, sources said. 
The three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25 
billion.

Business
RFID chip will help speed up business

05/14/2001
The New Straits Times
Main/Lifestyle; 2*

(Copyright 2001)

THE combination of recently developed "stick-on" Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP) 
will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas 
industry. 
And Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning.
Global management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice 
which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this 
idea locally. 
Global Energy Strategy Practice partner Paul Spence said that applying this 
latest combined technology, car owners can fill up a petrol tank without 
resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card. 
Relevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and 
the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science 
fiction movie. 
This surreal development is made possible through the application of 
ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate 
with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence. 
Such technology is economically available today. "There are technology 
suppliers who are offering these capabilities." 
The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry. 
Communications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals 
to restricted zones. 
In an interview in Petaling Jaya recently, Spence said: "A lot of my clients 
now are asking, whether that same technology can be used to restrict access 
into hazardous areas, plants or production sites. 
"Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant? There 
are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that." 
"Guru in the field" is another potential application where a combination of 
RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal 
computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site. 
"An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype 
mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other 
side of the world. 
"The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity 
markets is to lock them in tighter correlation. 
"The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets 
are shortening within the energy industry. Enron which is the biggest oil 
trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives." 
Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and 
gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to 
remain connected to global markets.

India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation

Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is 
expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15. 
While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power 
purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is 
expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, 
sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate 
with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon 
meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report.
"The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB," a source said. 
"The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and 
transmission." While generation and transmission can be controlled by the 
State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5 
lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the 
board into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due 
to fear of privatisation. 
MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to 
delay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is 
expected to address the problem in detail. 
Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: "...none of the 
solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in 
particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its 
distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report." 
The report is expected to "suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the 
interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of 
Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and 
safeguarded," according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the 
committee. 
The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr 
E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay 
Mohan Lal. The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of 
the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of 
negotiations with Enron.

The Smart Investor
Tertiary will be primary
Indira Vergis

These are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters 
that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies. 
Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a 
bout of slightly lower growth. 
But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the 
region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP 
grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank.
Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the 
prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per 
cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest 
performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up 
the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural 
performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard. 
However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from 
a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to 
see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon. 
An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And, 
they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move. 
Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange 
reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian 
currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of 
control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil 
prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut 
may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector, 
stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon. 
Rain, rain, come again 
For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP 
level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year. 
"According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by 
around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J 
M Morgan Stanley Securities. 
In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a 
subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a 
row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent 
compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for 
only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by 
economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because 
of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption 
side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research 
Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries," 
he adds. 
More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on 
agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for 
everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like 
tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good 
monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent. 
In service of the economy 
Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services. 
India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to 
transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth 
weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this 
important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most 
economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge 
slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that 
overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry 
numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it 
will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan. 
Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and 
other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7 
per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to 
show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking 
Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies. 
Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax 
reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more 
people to buy houses. 
Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services, 
says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the 
world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing, 
though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money 
spinners in the years ahead. 
The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment. 
"The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth 
rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100 
Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone. 
A good home show 
And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the 
gloom over its performance. 
Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest 
rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy 
increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year. 
While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is 
that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at 
which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven 
per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale 
price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices 
will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to 
exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the 
industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on 
rural demand. 
Neighbours' envy 
And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact 
of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to 
remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are 
less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to 
shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian 
nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand. 
With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is 
clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP 
comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the 
Philippines. 
Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports 
remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20 
per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of 
good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same 
period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per 
cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from 
$12.79 billion the previous year. 
Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American 
slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a 
quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70 
per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important 
software exports destination. 
Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living 
overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on 
India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic 
turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill 
threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from 
invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to 
the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit. 
It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of 
Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to 
between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion. 
Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from 
$6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression. 
"They are still talking about growth. It is a decline in the growth rate and 
not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive 
officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to 
maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who 
live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment," 
says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months 
to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same 
period. 
Foreign institutions support 
Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too. 
Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's 
equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the 
whole of calendar 2000. 
Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months, 
investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and 
seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios, 
some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say. 
Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see 
India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band. 
Yet some hesitation 
Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government 
opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including 
pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence. However, 
tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India. 
In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the 
previous year to $2.4 billion. Yet, China a market India is frequently 
compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in 
the same period. Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start 
investment in the country. "It's a pittance and it probably will remain 
stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house. 
The reasons are not hard to find. Foreigners seeking to invest in India have 
many fences to cross. Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic 
infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often 
left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India. 
The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring 
concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power 
project in Dabhol in Maharashtra. After being forced to renegotiate a power 
supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines 
once again. 
This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay 
its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its 
commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation 
that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply 
pull out of the project altogether. A disturbing turn of events, since, till 
recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India. 
It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign 
investor to pull out of a project. Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had 
also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing 
endless bureaucratic hurdles. 
And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300 
million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly. Many 
international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up 
operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market. Now many are struggling to 
break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for 
success. That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors, 
India still remains a tough sell. 
Outlook 
With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six 
per cent. Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget 
could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy. Strong 
measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment. These 
are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run. 
The recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment, 
although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable. Still, every 
bit helps. The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to 
accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic 
powerhouse are to be realised. After all, for the second most populous nation 
in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still 
nowhere near the figure its size suggests.

Italian brokers Rasfin SIM have indicated the potential for growth in the 
shares of Acegas, the former municipal utility of the Italian city of 
Trieste. Acegas closed the first quarter of this year with turnover of L137bn 
(+45 per cent). Results attributed in part to the start of production of 
Estenergy, a consortium of the utilities of Udine, Trieste, Gorizia and Enron 
of the US, which supplies energy and services to parts of Friuli. 
Also significant, according to Rasfin, were investments over the period, 
which totalled L43bn.

Sometimes even Cabinet officers can lose their way in the White House. So 
there was Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, clearly lost 
Friday at a fork in a corridor near White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's 
office. 
"How do you get to the Oval Office?" he asked a group of reporters and was 
directed to the right door, according to a wire report.
Fleischer, though, told reporters that was the wrong answer. 
"How do you get to the Oval Office? First you win the Iowa caucus, then you 
lose the New Hampshire primary, then you make a comeback in South Carolina," 
he quipped as he recalled President Bush's early primary campaign last year. 
Passport, Please 
Meanwhile, folks at Thompson's HHS may be taking to calling him "Tightwad 
Tommy." Seems a memo went out March 15 undermining Alaska and Hawaii's claims 
to be part of the United States. 
Employees "must clear . . . international travel" with the office of the 
deputy chief of staff for operations, said the memo from the deputy chief, Ed 
Sontag. To clarify, "HHS employees seeking to travel outside the continental 
U.S." for meetings and conferences, must get permission and then file trip 
reports within two weeks. 
This sent officials calling around, asking whether trips to those states were 
to go through the international travel approval system just as if they were 
going to Russia or the Congo. 
Apparently so. The edict would appear to include even the nearby Virgin 
Islands and practically next-door Puerto Rico as well. Loop Fans can only 
hope this outrage doesn't spread to other agencies. It would make for some 
cold winters. 
Chewing Out on the Bush Beat 
Speaking of Fleischer, the usually affable spokesman is not reluctant to get 
tough with reporters when he believes they've stepped out of line. 
Sheriff Fleischer was on duty Thursday and upset with Houston Chronicle 
reporter Bennett Roth. Bush that morning urged parents to talk more to their 
kids about the dangers of drugs. 
Roth, at Fleischer's daily briefing, asked: "Ari, the president talked about 
parental involvement today. How much has he talked to his own daughters about 
both drugs and drinking? And given the fact that his own daughter was cited 
for underage drinking, isn't that a sign that there's only so much effect 
that a parent can have on their children's behavior?" 
Fleischer responded brusquely: "No, I think, frankly, there are some issues 
where I think it's very important for you all in the press corps to recognize 
that he is the president of the United States; he's also a father. And the 
press corps has been very respectful in the past of treating family matters 
with privacy, and I'm certain that you're going to do so again. I hope so." 
Fleischer later called Roth to chastise him, telling him his question had 
been "noted in the building." 
Competing to Oversee the Corps 
Former Mississippi representative Mike Parker, a Democrat-turned-Republican 
who lost a gubernatorial bid a couple of years back, had been seen as the 
pick to be assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, overseeing the 
Army Corps of Engineers. 
Parker, a former undertaker, had support from the barge industry, the various 
corps constituencies and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott, the majority leader 
of the Senate. 
But the Pentagon's choice was Lawrence Izzo, recently retired president of 
Enron Engineering and Construction Co. who has been in the mix for several 
jobs. Izzo, a West Point grad, had 23 years at the Corps before going to 
Enron, former home of Army secretary-designate Thomas White. 
The majority leader was said to be most unhappy. The latest word is Parker's 
getting the job. 
Ex-Reporters Move On 
Kenneth J. Klein, a former reporter who has worked for 17 years for Florida 
Sen. Bob Graham (D), most recently as chief of staff, is joining the Outdoor 
Advertising Association of America as executive vice president for government 
relations. 
Former Washington Post colleague Thomas W. Lippman, a 33-year national, 
foreign and financial reporter and author who became vice president of 
communications at the World Wildlife Fund in 1999, is moving next month to be 
managing director at communications consulting firm Chlopak, Leonard, 
Schechter & Associates.

Largest LNG 13 Conference Opens Today

05/14/2001

The largest-ever International Conference and Exhibition on liquefied natural 
gas (LNG 13) opens today for a four-day run at the Convention and Exhibition 
Center (COEX) in southern Seoul. 
A total of 125 companies and organizations represented by 2,500 delegates and 
exhibitors from 50-odd countries, including Japan, the United States, Britain 
and Australia, are participating in the international event, co- organized by 
the Korea Gas Union and the Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS).
Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Che-shik will be delivering 
congratulatory remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Han-dong who is 
currently on an official trip to the Middle East. There will be a visual 
presentation from Lee during the opening ceremony. 
``We have spent more than a year preparing for this international event which 
is the largest in terms of the number of participants and exhibitors,'' said 
Lee Seung-hwan, chairman of the Korean National Organizing Committee. 
LNG 13 is 15 percent larger than the conference and exhibition held in 
Australia back in 1998 which reflects the growth of the industry, Lee 
explained, adding that the demand for LNG has been increasing rapidly here in 
Korea. 
A wide range of topics will be presented during the four days of conferences 
and exhibitions, helping to showcase the importance of the LNG industry. 
Among the numerous papers to be presented at the triennial event are ``Old 
World, New World, Tomorrow's World: How LNG Has Changed Since LNG 12'' and 
``The Next Generation of LNG Plants.'' 
``Hosting this meaningful event in Korea will help elevate Korea's image in 
the international market, particularly with the sheer scale and size of LNG 
13,'' said Kim Myung-kyu, president and CEO of KOGAS and chairman of the 
Korea gas Union. 
The conference will include paper sessions, workshops, poster sessions and 
film presentations while exhibitors will demonstrate their exclusive 
technologies for the exploration and production of LNG as well as plant 
construction. 
The official sponsors of LNG 13 are the International Gas Union, the Gas 
Technology Institute and the International institute of Refrigeration while 
the major sponsors are Shell Gas and Power, KOGAS, LG-Caltex, SK-Enron, the 
Qatari Group, TotalFinaElf, British Petroleum and Exxon Mobile. 
In addition to the conference and exhibition, there will be a technical visit 
to the Inchon LNG Receiving Terminal in Inchon, about 50 kilometers west of 
Seoul, on Friday.

i think thats rite -think curve flattens somewhat.back end the overvalued
part for now. i think we more consolidate sideways choppy for a few sessions
but if the present  rate of injections continue the end users/utilties will
have to stop buying cuz of real phys limitations to take the gas into
storage. funds short but only 6% of open int and have covered later part of
last week.
  think vol comes in again too.i think it sale 4.50 scale up-talked to some
others to o thinking it cant go below 4.00 so i actually think more the
suprise in the short term for a break of 4.00!! so who knows/cud work the
other way.
   agree-disappointed at lack of producer selling-we had one deal come thur
but its been worked for months so not price relevant.
  when are you in town next?

Jennifer - just wanted to give you a quick SAP update - we have some traction 
still with them. We are going to provide them with a proposal for the 
4-eurpoean cities mentioned during the last conference call. On the low-end 
it is a $2.09M deal with the high-end (lower probability) could be $8M-plus.

We hope to have firms numbers to them late next week. We also had a conf-call 
with Commerce One that did not go well with respect to bandwidth, however we 
are still going to pursue the reseller potential with them for next quarter.

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's
you bid/offer on playing this game?  (would you pay $.5 to play? $1? $2?
what you charge me play against you?)

rules to a game:
You flip a coin. If you get tails you win 0.  if you get heads, i give you
$1.  Keep flipping until you get a tails, at which point you walk away with
the money.  however, each heads you get after the first you double your
money.  So if you flip heads 3 times and then tails, you get $4.  What's

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological 
$4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short.  next 
sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this week with 
williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of 
the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will get more common 
here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe 
in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some 
shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like it did when we were 
trying to break $5.Message-ID: <23249397.1075857603991.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

     In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very
viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under
either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company
A,
and so on.

     The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the
price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

     Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration
project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

     As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price
offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

     $______ per/share

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

John,

Do you think we need to see about sending an IT Tech for you and Maggi on

 Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number at
the end.  You should be ready to defend your answer.  Only a number is
allowed, not an algebraic equation.

Acquiring a Company

 In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),
which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means of
a tender offer.  You plan to tender in cash for 100% of Company T's shares
but are unsure how high a price to offer.  The main complication is this:
the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil
exploration project it is currently undertaking.  Indeed, the very viability
of Company T depends on the exploration outcome.  If the project fails, the
company under current management will be worth nothing--$0/share.  But if
the project succeeds, the value of the company under current management
could be as high as $100/share.  All share values between $0 and $100 are
considered equally likely.  By all estimates, the company will be worth
considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.
In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the company
will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under
Company T.  If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under either
management.  If the exploration project generates a $50/share value under
current management, the value under Company A is $75/share.  Similarly, a
$100/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,
and so on.

 The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price
they should offer for Company T's shares.  This offer must be made now,
before the outcome of the drilling project is known.  From all indications,
Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at a
profitable price.  Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, the
potential of a takeover bid by any other firm.  You expect Company T to
delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, then
accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches
the press.

 Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration project
when submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results when
deciding whether or not to accept your offer.  In addition, Company T will
accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value of
the company under current management.  Thus, if you offer $50/share, for
instance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is
anything less than $50.

 As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offers
in the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to
$150/share.  What price offer per share would you tender for Company T's
stock?

 $______ per/share

Mr. Shankman:

In preparation for the meeting on December 12th with Larry Kellner, CFO, 
Continental Airlines, I have noted below some background on the 
Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  Mr. 
Shankman, please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the 
attendees.    

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continental's crude oil.  
The relationship has been beneficial to both sides.  As a result, since 1999 
Enron has made over $9 million and Continental has saved over $45 million.  

The purpose for the December 12th meeting is to address three initiatives in 
order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and 
(3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.   Several new initiatives being 
proposed to Continental include the following:   

exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau, 
Originator)  
transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator)  
creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawney 
and Gary Taylor, Originators)
outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these 
products with Enron (Alan Engberg, Originator)

Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:

Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services
Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company
Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)

Meeting Attendees from Enron:
Jeff Shankman, President and COO, Enron Global Markets
John Nowlan, Vice President, Enron Global Markets
Craig Breslau, Vice President, Enron North America
Mark Tawney, Director, Enron Global Markets (tentative) 

DISCUSSION: 
(Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg, Larry Gagliardi, Gary 
Taylor, Craig Breslau, Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz.)

Enron Buy Side with Continental:

Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was 
approximately $40 million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six 
months of 2000.  

Enron Sell Side with Continental:

(1) FUEL MANAGEMENT: 

Current Business:  Over the past 2 years, Craig Breslau and others have been 
managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford, VP, Continental Fuel 
Management, hedging Continental's crude oil.  The first transaction was on 
January 14, 1998 -- a one month Forward on Kero.  Since then, Enron has 
completed 29 transactions with two commodities:  KERO and Crude.  Current 
business consists of three crude call options, settling in December 2000 
($31.00) and January, 2001 ($34.00 and $35.00)

Value to Enron: Enron has earned $9,682,084 (1999-October 6, 2000)

Value to Continental:  Continental has saved $45,001,744 (1999-October 6, 
2000)

Possible next steps:    (a) A transaction where Enron exchanges call options 
on crude oil for airline tickets.

(b) Financial jet swaps on line:  Larry Gagliardi has already spoken with 
Rick Pressly, Director, Continental Fuel Management, regarding financial jet 
swaps on line.   At the time, Pressly was not interested in pursuing this 
product offering.  

Value to Continental for (b):  a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging 
with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge.  
Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multi-year options 
as well both with financial and physical jet fuel.

Possible next steps:  Would Larry Kellner be interested in (a) or (b)?  Enron 
could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following 
locations such as the US Gulf Coast, New York harbor, the US West Coast, and 
Europe.  (Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor).  
If so, Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Online 
identification number if Kellner's office wanted to review the product.

(2) WEATHER DERIVATIVE  PRODUCT:

Business proposition:  Create a basket of weather related risks - such that 
aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from 
Enron to Continental.

Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their 
annual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussing 
earnings.  It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge 
for all of Continental's weather related exposure.  However, it is not 
difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it.  
Continental has hubs in Houston, Newark, and Cleveland.  The weather 
conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include - 
rainfall above certain amounts, snowfall above certain amounts, temperatures 
below freezing (de-icing costs), winds above a certain speed, etc.  

Value to us:  Create value by designing a basket of these risks.  

Value to them:  Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continental's exposure.

Possible next steps:   Upper management would need to issue a directive to 
various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect 
the bottom line, how much they affect the bottom line, and then ask each 
group to attach a "confidence level" to each of their estimates - Continental 
could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted 
average of their exposure x their confidence level - or some portion thereof.

Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following:

Clear exposure.  Quantifiable.
Clear exposure.  Difficult to quantify
Potential exposure.  Quantifiable
Potential exposure.  Difficult to quantify

For each of the above categories, Enron would also need an indication of 
whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress 
historical weather data.

Enron's weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel, 
Director and Airport Services Division Controller, and some of his team (or 
others designated by Kellner) and brainstorm about different types of weather 
that cause increased cost to Continental.  (Gary Taylor made a brief 
presentation to Rummel on November 6th; no follow up action with Enron has 
taken place to date)  

(3)  PLASTICS:

Business proposition:    Alan Engberg proposed that Continental outsource 
their antifreeze risk (ethylene glycol / propylene glycol) and plastics (high 
impact polystyrene, polyethylene) by hedging those products with Enron.

Value to Continental: Cost/Budget certainty (assuming a perfect hedge whereby 
their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) and 
associated reduction in volatility of cash flows

Value to Enron:  The value is approximately $2 million notional value if they 
hedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure.  Since Continental 
has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, Engberg cannot comment 
on the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be much 
larger than $2 million.

Possible next steps
This proposition is being considered by Ron Howard's team at Continental.  
Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron.  Enron could 
then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of 
outsourcing their commodity risk to Enron.  Could a follow-up meeting with 
Ron Howard's team and Larry Kellner's designated contact be arranged to 
facilitate this process?

Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach 
to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful 
and rewarding to both companies.  David Port is already (x-39823)  looking at 
ways to outsource Enron's expertise in this area.  Continental could be a 
pioneer in the effort.  Factors to model would
include jet fuel, natural gas, electricity, currency, interest rates, 
plastics, antifreeze, paper, and, metal.Message-ID: <831944.1075857604735.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

IMPORTANT MEMO



Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Channel Inside FERC

Hi Eric,


Please find below the detailed terms of a possible deal that we have been
talking about during our phone conversation this morning.


Nature of deal : If the transaction takes place, Societe Generale would sell a
financial fixed price swap (flat price, not basis differential) to Enron. The
monthly settlement would be financial. There would not be any  exchange of
physical product.


Period of the deal : June 1st, 2001 to January 31st, 2021.


Used Reference :  Natural Gas-Houston Ship Channel Index Inside FERC , monthly
settlement.



Volumes of the financial swap transaction : Please find below the volumes 
given
month by month in MMBTU.

(See attached file: volumes-10-5-01-for-Enron.xls)

Since there is a tiny chance that the deal trades today, could you please 
check
if you have credit with SG for this period.
If not, could you find out how much time it approximately takes to get the
credit.
In terms of credit, SG is good with Enron for this period.

Thank you,

Alexander Werner

i think the velocity of the down move will be much less severe from here.  
still dont think this is equilibrium.  need to see aga coming in lower than 
expectations for a couple weeks signaling that we've moved down the demand 
curve.  think a lot of spec shorts are looking to take profits as we get 
close to the psychological 400 target.  market needs producer selling to get 
us through there.  have seen some as williams is starting to hedge barrett : 
hence the weakness in the back of the curve recently.  still going lower but 
it will be a tougher move from here.

Enron has a couple of suites reserved strictly for Enron use.  Each one holds 
21 people and the cost would be $2550 without food.  If we needed another 
suite then, Enron Field would charge us $100 per person as long as one of 
their suites is available.

John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally "False"


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

         INPUTS           OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  >220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  <30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  <10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  <4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  >3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  >20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). 
Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

I don't think we have much interest in doing this interview since it 
primarily pertains to our views of the market.  I would speak in such

Subject: RISK Magazine Interview

John:
Kevin Foster with Risk Magazine is working on an article for the June issue 
regarding Gas Markets in the U.S. Basically, he is interested in Enron's 
opinion of:

1. Physical Supply/Demand of gas and how this is affecting financial trades
2. Where do we anticipate gas prices going over the summer?
3. The state of the industry--any major issues that may affect the market?

If this sounds like a story we would be interested in doing, please let me 
know and I will coordinate a short phone interview with Kevin Foster. I know 
it usually works best for your schedule to do this after 4pm, so please let 
me know if Tuesday after 4 would be good for you. 

Thanks for your help and please call me with any questions.

your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our
customer biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell
blood among the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant
see straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right
now i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at
this level though.

i guess i have to keep my 395 price target.  just nothing bullish in the near 
term except crude.  and that's not enough now.  need to get to a new price 
regime to pick up more demand quickly.

your guys are probably seeing this as well, but, 50 cents higher our customer 
biz was 95/5 from buy side.  now it's 50/50.  can almost smell blood among 
the producers.  only problem is trade is sooooo short they cant see 
straight.  were the market still not so fundamentally overvalued right now 
i'd be looking for a 25 cent move up.  just can't see that happening at this 
level though.  Message-ID: <12397991.1075857605264.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Hey Adam:
sorry for the delay.  just been very busy.  congrats on joining enron.  think 
you made the right chioce.  i would recommend structuring.  it's a good way 
to understand how enron works, how we look at and manage risk, and you get 
close to the trading component.  a friend of mine, ed mcmichael runs the gas 
structuring group.  try emiling him probably at emcmich@enron.com.  keep in 
touch,
john

Hi John,

I hope your gas markets are moving nicely this week.  Its
been a long time since we talked, but a lot has happened.
But the most important thing has been my decision to join
Enron. At this point, I am looking around for a rotation,
and I have received a lot of advice pointing me towards
Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations.  I am wondering if
you know some people in these areas who might be looking
for analysts.  I have heard that traders work closely with
the structured finance and RAC guys, true?  If you have
time please let me know if you know of anything.

Thanks,

Adam Bayer

John - I got a call from Warren Tashnek today.  He is concerned about the 
usage of the Fimat line because the trading volume is not covering its 
costs.   He wanted to know how to increase business with Enron.  I referred 
him to you.  As you know, he is so nice and not trying to start a fight with 
us but needs more trades to justify the cost of the line.  Will you please 
address this with him?

Jennifer and Peter, welcome back...!

Attached are the notes from the EBS team and BMC organization regarding the 
proposals to EBS and Net Works (etc.) from BMC.

I am curious, Peter (or Glenn), if it is reasonable of BMC to make the 
statement to the effect that, "...the 45% discount is applied only if
we have the EBS Enron Partnership agreement in place...".  Is that cutting it 
close on the restraint of trade issue?

Bob McAuliffe has informed me in a note that if his people (Matson & Cumming) 
choose the BMC product at testing conclusion, he would support their 
decision.  Smith and Ogg have given "no go" indications.  I have received 
that information from Bruce Smith in a telephone conversation, but Jim Ogg's 
lack of communication with me is what I have used to draw a similar 
conclusion for his situation...

BMC and EBS both, I believe, are wanting GSS to do the contract work for this 
deal.  It is my understanding, Peter, that the timing of that request might 
be a problem for your guys...Perhaps we should have a quick, informal pow-wow 
about this?

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff,

Attached are all the outstanding deal proposals from BMC.  Lets push for some 
addl discounts so we can get each of these guys a "win".  I have asked our 
BMC contacts to reduce these quotes already due to our partnership but I am 
sure you know how to handle this best.

We need your help Jeff, we cant do it without you.

Hi Steve,

It was nice talking to you.  Included here are the Product quotes that we
sent to the groups.  The Incontrol has multiple spreadsheets for Bruce
Smith's projects.  Real Media is for Everett.  The other two are self
explanatory.

The concern that we have is that there is still not a quote for Jim Ogg and
therefore it is not a quantified amount for the deal we're doing together.
That is significant because it effects discounts, volume, and certainly the
more BMC product that Enron targets the better for this deal.

As mentioned in the phone call, I'll send you a soft copy of the Enron Corp
(which includes EBS) software license agreement with BMC if I can get it for
you.  Otherwise it will be a hard copy when you come over today.  It
includes the terms of liability, warranty, etc.

I look forward to seeing you today.

Best regards,
Ann

		 Subject: The EBS Enron agreement

Hi Jeff,

I hope you are doing well.  There have been some interesting developments on
the way to the Enron Broadband/BMC agreement since we last spoke.
Apparently, it is extremely important to Jim Crowder to get this agreement
in place by December 15.  As a result of the conversation between Jim
Crowder and Jeff Hawn, BMC Exec., I have been directed to help Steve Morse
and Chaz Vaughan in leveraging the best deal possible for the various
projects that Enron is considering with BMC.  As you are aware, we have
already proposed several individual deals.  In addition to those we are
including some deals in which there has been an expressed interest so that
Enron can take advantage of the pricing that this partnership will bring to
you.

The purpose of this e-mail is to give you a heads up on the acceleration of
timing that we have been directed to work towards and to let you know that
we have already agreed to bring our price down in order to make the price
more attractive to Enron.  We would very much appreciate your help in
expediting the process of bringing this agreement to closure.  In my next
e-mail I will send you a list of all the outstanding BMC proposals to Enron.

Hi Jeff,

I'm sure you already realize this, but for the sake of clarification, it's

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

Jeff:
To explain the P&L of -349,000  : 
We executed the trade when you gave the order (the delta anyway), first thing 
in the morning.  The market rallied 8 cents from the morning, with the back 
rallying about 2.5 cents.  On 904 PV contracts, curve shift was -226,000.  
The balance, $123,000,  is almost exactly $.01 bid/mid, which I think is 
pretty fair considering the tenor of the deal and that it included price and 
vol.  Cal 3 straddles, for instance, are $1.39 / $1.45.

Looking out for you bubbeh:
John

Following are the working transactions in the Central Region/Gas that include 
utility/producer outsourcing:

3rd Quarter

Peoples Energy Production Company
PEPC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples Energy/Chicago.   Transaction 
consists of back-office, risk management and production management for their 
Production company.  Currently performing due diligence and will be making 
proposal (in conjunction with Jean Mrha's group).  Total volume of 30,000 
MMbtu/d oil/gas equivalent for 3 years.   50% probability for closure.

4th Quarter

MGU-Michigan Gas Utilities
MGU is wholly owned subsidiary of Utilicorp.  Transaction is a complete 
outsourcing for the utility (28 BCF/year) for a term of 3 years beginning 
October 2001.  MGU will choose a singular counter-party to proceed to 
structure/negotiations in the next few weeks.  We have received very positive 
feedback from MGU and place our success rate at > 50%.  Original transaction 
priced as Michigan Index trade, but effort was to determine their choice 
counterparty.  Initial indications are that the final structure will consist 
of a basket of index Daily/FOM and fixed price.  Russell Murrell and I have 
been working closely with the decision makers at MGU to ensure success.

SEMCO (Project Pluto)
Utility based in Port Huron, Michigan with sales load of approximately 37 
BCF/year.  Portfolio currently outsourced to TransCanada (4/1/1999-3/31/2002) 
and has been extremely beneficial to SEMCO.  TransCanada (See Gas Daily 
4/30/01) currently holds all fixed priced risk for load following and 
management at around $3.60 and SEMCO was the only Michigan utility who 
effectively managed the arrangements the Michigan utilities negotiated with 
their commission.  Bids are due in August and a counterparty will be chosen 
3rd/4th quarter 2001 for a 3 year transaction commencing 4/1/2002.   Visited 
their office with Sylvia Pollan on 4/11 and our risk is removing the 
incumbent, TransCanada.   SEMCO will be proposing a fixed price structure to 
Michigan commission.

On MGU and SEMCO, the Michigan commission will play a significant role in 
dictating final structures.  If Enron is not successful, these utilities will 
be managed by other 3rd parties and we will keep you abreast of structure 
outcomes.

Thanx,
Laura

Arnold,

I am trying to talk via MSN messenger service and it will not accept 
jarnold@enron.com or any other reasonable email path.  What is your official 
email path?  I am assuming that you are using Outlook.  I am here at work 
trying to close a deal.

I will forward your message to Grass, but I want to visually see the layout 
of the floor.  I will end up having spots on five and six.  Also,  Nelson 
Ferries' and Linda Roberts' location are very important to the 
Wellhead/Ecommerce effort.  And yes, John will need room to grow. 

What did you think of the article?

Hi All,

I think we should play hard ball with these guys.  They want a great deal 
more business, and we are going to have to see something in return for us to 
pull this trigger this year or early next year.  Lets have them help us find 
opportunity.  Also - Gary's idea of longer term is a good one.  Especially 
for a company of this size.

Re Rex, all BW deals go through EBS so we are accountable for the BW 
opportunity.

Couple things

1.  Dale/Patrick - can you guys please get involved here.  Gary has done a 
good job bringing in a live deal.  We need some focus to make it happen.
2.  Paula - can you please setup a conf call for Thurs, 11/30, morn.  Gary, 
Jennifer S, Dale, Tucker, and myself should be on the call.

Thanks!

MH

Gary,
On the Rex issue, I think that we need to talk to him.  I am under the 
impression that he does not get compensated for broadband but I might be 
wrong.

Spoke with Curtis today:

- he is still waiting for Dietmar to provide us the international cities etc 
so that we can size the opportunity
- reiterated what we learned on the call -- their is no storage opporunity 
since they self-serve
- told him we doubted that their network is at 60-70% utilization and there 
may be some intermediation opp yet to be discovered
- we talked extensively about EBS' concern that the size of this deal appears 
small, my comment was that we can create a larger deal by extending the terms 
to 10-years (or something greater than 2 years) with bi-annual renewals, this 
also ensures the two companies pro-actively work with each other
- Curits keeps asking me about deal size and I stated that if we don't get 
specific requirements from SAP we can not place a value on the deal so there 
is no use trying to pull a number out of thin air.
- Curtis asked about Rex and whether he gets comped for broadband - he is 
concerned about cutting Rex out since they were his first contact, I need 
help on this -- Anyone?

Bottom Line - ball is in their court to provide us details so we can take 
something to structuring and size the opportunity.

After our meeting with Dell on 10/27, I sent a request to Charlie Ball (works 
for Kip) for detailed power data from TXU. Charlie delegated the task of 
getting this data to Randy Don Carlos, who has yet to return any of my calls 
to update the status of the request.

Charlie Ball left me a message this morning indicating that Randy Don Carlos 
was leaving Dell at the end of the month. He indicated that he will get the 
information to me as soon as he can. I'm not sure, but it seems that no one 
has sent the request to TXU yet. TXU generally will send out data within 1-2 
weeks of a request. It has now been 6 weeks since we asked Dell for the data. 
Assuming Charlie actually gets someone to send the data request to TXU, we 
should get something by the end of the year.

Similarly, Continental has not yet sent over data that they were to request 
from HL&P. I talked with someone in Mark's group on 12/4, and she indicated 
that they had the data, but their real estate group wanted to review it 
before they sent it to us. On this one also, it is unlikely that any 
transaction will get done in this calendar year.

Please call if you have any questions.Message-ID: <18589095.1075857605814.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Arnold,

John Grass and myself would be happy to update you on the status of Enron's 
Producer One deals.  In addition to the three deals listed below, we have a 
substantial "pipeline" of transactions that are being evaluated and are in 
different stages.  Besides John Grass, our distribution channels for producer 
ecommerce deals are driven by Producer Services (Gary Bryan, Jill Zivley, 
Linda Roberts and Jennifer Martinez), Nelson Ferries, Production Offshore as 
well as ECR.  Enron has just recently completed a nine city road show 
targeting the producer community.  

John Grass is also managing the Wellhead desk.

Regards, Mrha

Jennifer & Shirley Jo

As per our earlier conversations, Jim Kirkpatrick (buyer) and I formulated 
the attached two (2) spreadsheets regarding OEC Central Purchasing's spending 
habits over the past two (2) years.  
I have only listed vendors/contractors where we have received in access of 
$5k per month and who I feel should be approached about a purchasing 
agreement that would benefit all Enron Divisions.
If you have any questions feel free to call.

Sincerely,
Jim Meyer

ps I know Roy Hartstein and Michael Frost in your group are interest in this 
also.

1.   don't know.  some industrial shutdown is not gas price dependent.  some 
will not come back at the same prices it went off.  residential conservation 
i think is underestimated and has a severe lag effect that will not come back 
as prices fall.  as far as switching i dont think #2 is the floor some people 
think it is.  maybe #6 is the floor.
2.  you know my outlook for xh,  with slightly above normal weather jan goes 
out at 2.75 and that is not constrained by a #6 floor.  next jv, too far away 
to really run the numbers but think natty reestablishes itself as a 
$2.50-3.50 commodity.  
3. the obvious
4. yes.  believe if we end at 2.6 in the ground, the current nymex forward 
curve may be fairly priced.  my belief is that at the current prices we will 
end up with much more than 2.6 and that $5 is not value if we have 2.8 in the 
ground and gaining y on y.  circular argument that leads to my belief that 
prices must fall.
5.  not necessarily.  will loss of demand with normal weather cancel the fact 
that there will be much less demand destruction.  probably.

Subject: Understanding the natural view


1- The above spreadsheet looks at HO-NG seasonally. It gives perspective on 
'normal relationships'. 

Things I need to clarify about your ng view
1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial 
shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not 
end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?
5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this 
winter?

John,

I heard from Wes Colwell that you had been appointed by Lavorato to layout 
the sixth floor for gas.  This morning I spoke to Wes regarding the placement 
of the Upstream/Ecommerce desk on six.  I have taken 6 spaces but I need two 
more.  The two I would like to use (e29 & e30) are currently being occupied 
by the Central Region.  I would like to move these individuals to two spots 
right across from their current location (e35 & e36).


For your information, the current six spots that I have are :  e17, e18, e21, 
e22, e23 and e24.

Please call when you can.  Good luck trading...

Regards, Mrha

		 Subject: Computer Associates - Meeting Notes

Stephen Down and I met with Computer Associates in Toronto yesterday. Here 
are some of my thoughts on how it went.

We met with Julia in the morning -- went to CA's Toronto office, where we 
made presentation on EBS. Later Julia made a presentation on Computer 
Associates, their Sales manager talked about their "security suit of 
products", we were given a demonstration of their UniCenter TNG software, and 
then taken to lunch.  At lunch, we were joined by the President of Worldwide 
Online Corporation (a Canadian startup).

About Computer Associates:
Computer Associates is a highly centralized organization run by its founders. 
The company is the third largest independent software manufacturing business 
in the world. It offers more then 800 software products. Like other companies 
in their space, their stock has taken a beating this year losing more then 
half its value (Jan 00: ~ $70, now ~$27)

Julia Ruslys, is part of their "Strategic Alliances" team -- their mandate is 
to manage:
Strategic Business Alliances
Development Partner Program
eForce technology unit
Analyst relations

CA's APPROACH
Computer Associates sees EBS as a potential "development partner". Their 
interest seems to be in a long-term alliance with EBS, where they can package 
their software with a bundled network offering (from EBS) for their clients. 
They claim that their main product UniCenter TNG has a 30% market share of IT 
infrastructure management market. It is a cutting software package that can 
manage all LANs or remote networks for an Enterprise. With a stunning graphic 
interface, the software can be configured to manage:
All networks within an Enterprise
Each computer connected to a node within the enterprise can be monitored and 
managed remotely (software installation etc.)
Their is a plethora of add-ons to the basic UniCenter package including some 
advanced "Asset Management" tools that can predict future utilization through 
a neural network architecture.

She commented that with UniCenter TNG, our clients have "full control and 
flexibility over their whole network" EXCEPT  THEIR BANDWIDTH NEEDS.  EBS's 
flexible and intelligent BOS, if integrated with UniCenter TNG, can provide 
an enterprise complete control over their IT infrastructure with exceptional 
flexibility. Similarly they have a keen interesting in developing and 
expanding their storage solutions.

They seem to be interested in expanding their market opportunity and 
increasing revenues through increasing the number of "CA certifications" and 
joint selling initiatives. In other words, they would like EBS's network to 
be CA-certified by developing compatibility between UniCenter TNG and IPNet 
Connect. They currently have 1500 partners, including almost all top names in 
IT infrastructure space.

EBS APPROACH CONVEYED
Although I think we have conveyed EBS's approach of "looking at specific 
quick and clear opportunities", CA does not seem like a lean-mean 
organization. Furthermore, the people that we met with, did not seem to have 
an appreciation of the financial structuring and risk management capabilities 
-- instead seemed to be disconnected with the corporate financial goals of 
their organization. For example, when Steve Dowd talked about financial risk 
management tools, their sales manager started talking about how they help 
enterprises manage risk through their "security software packages."

WORLDWIDE ONLINE CORP.
Worldwide Online Corp. is a startup (with less then $2M revenues) that claims 
to have good connections with CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corp.)  They were in 
contact with Brad Sims' group out of Portland. That group, at some point lost 
interest in Worldwide because Worldwide are looking for video streaming 
services. Being a start-up with no credit, it is understandable why they were 
abandoned by us. Steve made it clear that he knows nothing about the deal and 
he may give Brad a call. I personally do not see anything for us in the next 
two quarters or so even though the company has been promised many sports 
broadcast opportunities by CBC.

It is interesting that Worldwide Online is a small client of CA. Julia went 
out of her way to convince us to meet with Worldwide Online. At one point, I 
almost thought as if her main goal was to promote a dialogue between EBS and 
Worldwide online.

NEXT STEPS:
Steve and I made it clear that it will be important for us to look at some 
specific short to medium-term opportunity with CA. Julia is going to identify 
the people in her organization whom we can have constructive dialogue with 
regards to IP connectivity needs of CA (their network infrastructure 
procurement team.)  At the same time, we had to show an interest in bringing 
her team together with our product development people to see if any 
integration opportunities exist between UniCenter TNG and IPNet Connect 
BOS/Storage etc.

Will not be looking to put more money to work on the long only side for a

John -

Yes, we received your check and forms.  The check has been deposited and the
forms have been processed.  The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions
will begin on April 24th.

As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to
you in February, but I don't believe we got it back.  Also, I'm concerned
about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds
available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.

I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review
concerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.  I'm thinking we could
knock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge
funds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESS
manager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PM
tonight or tomorrow night.  With regards to the marginable equity for naked
options question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?

Thanks,
Mike

John,
We are trying to transfer your bloomberg account and need to know who within 
Enron North America can sign-off on this
contract.  Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we 
should forward it to?  We initially changed the 
name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of 
our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because
you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it 
has to be under your departments name
and we need someone to sign the contract.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Julie

Hi Julie. I noticed the contracts have been received.  However, "North 
America"
has been crossed off the contract. That is the name it was signed under and
still the current trading name for Emissions and Natural gas. Not sure if it
was a mistake or not. Anyway - please get back to me when you can. I am going
to try to set up a meeting with the gas guys for tomorrow 4/17. Thanks

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

schedule 30 min to sit down with me either mon or tues after 430.  if you 
want to get info, sending out an email survey is not the right way.  much

Hello Mr. Arnold,

Thank you for speaking with me today with Kenneth Parkhill.  Unfortunately,
none of my teammates are available to meet with you today.  Would you please
review our questionnaire and reply back to me with your comments about the
questionnaire and answers to any questions that apply to your work.

We will follow up with you later this week if we have questions.  Thank you

be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar 
to NG) that the world will not end.

Where does this get us:
1- Sell q3 HU crack and by Q4HO crack (By the time q3 prices out--the wind 
will have been taken out of HU sails - plus you can do it month 
avg--therefore less noise)
2-Benefit from heat's recent excitement -- sell HO calls (June -Aug), buy ng 
puts nov-jan

Ng-Disagree:
I think prices stay high through June. The big drop off come some where in 
July 15 to Aug 15 and downhill from there. (Looks like 1998)

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

John,

Sorry again...  my last 2 trades (EOL # 1112587 & 1112596 - I sell 1/2 day 
twice
@5.55 on May) were done again by mistake on US Gas Daily instead of NYMEX.

I have called your help desk to try to remove US Gas Daily from my NYMEX 
screen
which we cannot do so far unless I select each quote individually.  However 
this
would run the additional problem of not showing up new tenors you may 
introduce
over time.

Thank you and best regards,

Herve

the implied market on that from put spreads is 5.3:1.    I'll take 4:1.

Most import  - the wager - I will take the over on May NG (4.95). 2:1 is 
okay--- $5 per penny okay? 

Agree - Products
Rally is not different for products. 92% of heating oil is made ondemand  
(storage is not as important as in nat gas) Heat will get ugly this October 
and then give it up (unless we have 7 blizzzards in the Northeast very 
early). 
SOme things to consider :
1- in the next 3-4 weeks we will finish the very heavy maintenance season and 
be in full blown gasoline season.
- yields will be preferentially shifted for HU
3- nobody will pay any attention to HO
2-HO will have incremental demand due to utlity switching and will quietly 
build slower than last year 
4- therefore by September everyone will freak out
5- After the OCtober contract expires (HO) , everyone will realize (similar

Average volume is 35,000-40,000 on nymex of which about half is spreads.  So 
around 20,000 outrights trade.  We trade more than that on EOL.  Today's 
conditions 1000 lot market would be 3-4 cents wide.  have executed trades as 
large as 10,000 across a longer term and 1000 lot clips in the front 
frequently.

Subject: SUNRISE CAPITAL

This is a program trader in San Diego with about 1 Billion in Capital.  They 
concentrate on front month trading- both swaps and options.  they are looking 
for liquidity and want to know:

1. size of the financial markets- what is the daily trading volume like?
2. bid/offer on size.. like 10,000 to start and then 5,000..1,000 - only for 
the front month on swaps and options?
3. what kind of size we have seen go through directly from anyone?

They want to know this for nat gas: I can talk to John and Mike on this
Rus- can you please get this on WTI, heat, and unleaded.

I want to try to get this to them today... we'll be getting a lot of these 
inquiries.

Also, they trade through Carr futures, Merrill, Morgan Stanley, and 
JPM/Chase.. What they want to do is trade with us and then we'll give-up the 
trades to the above counterparties.. in effect, we will not have any credit 
exposure..I can explain this in our meeting.

Thanks,
CA

Karen,

Thank you for the update.  It looks like we'll plan on having the EBS/Avaya 
meetings on January 10th and 11th, 2001.  The first day will be a full day, 
the second will be 1/2 day, a.m. session.  You have asked me to provide a 
list of Enron attendees, titles, which day(s) they would likely attend, and 
some background information on the meeting(s) purposes.  An explanation of 
the meetings' proposed focus and probable attendees is in the attached 
meeting notes.  

The notes are from the November meeting which we coordinated and held for 
Enron Broadband Services and Dave Johnson.  By copy of this note to Kim 
Godfrey, we'll update the EBS executives on the meetings, and work on 
arranging their calendar availability.  So far, we have had the EBS execs' 
calendars penciled in for the time slot of January 9-11.  At this point, I 
would expect that the EBS attendee list would look something like this:  

Jim Crowder, VP, Enterprise Services; Enron Broadband Services - day 2 
Everett Plante, VP and CIO, Enron Broadband Services - day 2
Larry Ciscon, VP Software Architecture, EBS - day 1&2
  (selected team members of Larry's organization - individuals TBD by Larry) 
- day 1  
Steve Pearlman, VP, Strategic Development, EBS - day 2 and/or day 1
Kim Godfrey, Director, East Origination, EBS - day 1&2  
Jeff Youngflesh, Director, Business Development, Enron Global Strategic 
Sourcing - day 1&2  
    (others as suggested by Kim Godfrey or other EBS executive)

From Avaya, the EBS team would like to meet with Dave Johnson, Serge 
Minassian, John Stephenson, and their selected Avaya team members.  

Per my conversation with you earlier today, the Enron Broadband Services 
meetings w/Avaya will need to be scheduled such that the overall agenda will 
"flip-flop" day 1 with day 2.  Originally, the first day was going to be a 
half-day executive strategizing meeting in the p.m. (allowing for travel to 
NJ), and the 2nd day to be more a product- or solutions-focused effort, with 
a full day's agenda.  Based on the fact that Dave Johnson will only be 
available the morning of the 11th, the meeting schedule will be reversed, 
such that the "full day/products/solutions" meetings will precede the 
half-day executive strategy sessions.  I have checked w/Barbara Korp, and 
Serge Minassian and John Stephenson are both available on the 11th, as well 
(John Stephenson would have a hard stop at 10:30).


Thank you,

Jeff Youngflesh

Please send the agenda and the list of participants so that I can forward

Hi John !

My mistake again early morning...  I clicked on Gas Daily Henry Hub (EOL
#1107435,    I buy 5,000 MMBtu/day  May @ 5.51)  instead of NYMEX.

Could you change it to NYMEX ?

Thank you and sorry again,

Look what I found: http://www.60thompson.com/

There aren't many photos, but it sounds nice.  Travelocity.com shows
cheaper, promotional rates.  And I'll find out from Paula where she made
her reservations.

I'm done.  It's all up to you now.

Gentlemen:

Thank you for your time this morning. Patrick and I feel this call swayed a 
bit
off track, and would like to make some corrections to the messages that were
delivered today.

Enron is looking for a much deeper and more strategic relationship with HP 
than
a quick storage trade. We see  value in working to define a big picture which
both HP and Enron find rewarding. Ravi did a great job explaining our trading
model, so now you understand the role of the trading desk. Our job is to 
uncover
how best to use the trading desk in whatever strategic structure we build
together.

As we are both Fortune 20 companies, we feel there is a world of opportunity 
for
us together. Your internal initiative of "always on", fits well with our
bandwidth and storage on demand initiatives. We look forward to working with 
you
to figure out the best way to put them all together.

i read this as though 1.5 bcf/d of more switching takes place in the summer 
versus today.  is that because of the forward curves are backwardated for 2 
and contango for natty?

Subject: Incremental Fuel Switching For Distillate-- Summer Estimate

Given the shape of the curve, my guess for incremental substitution is 
1.5Bcf/d for No2 oil.  
So for the period  May-Sep01 an extra 1.5Bcf/d will be put back into the 
system due to No2 oil usage.

Mike:
Two questions regarding fees:
1.  What will you charge for placement fee on a 750,000-1,000,000 type 
investment into the hedge funds?
2.  I understand your cost structure is a little higher than Fidelity.  
However, I was charged over $1,000 on my option trade for a transaction that 
Fidelity charges $147.50.  Is there any justification?

Please understand that my basis for developing an account with Paine Webber 
is dependent upon an agressive fee structure.  I don't want to see my 
above-market returns compromised by high fees.

I'm asking for 20 tickets, possibly 40 depending on whether they have spouces 
attending. Make a note for the calander. I'm thinking we can use this to get 
people like Paul Tudor Jones, Louis Bacon, etc. to attend an Enron function, 
while also gving the traders an opportunity to go as well.

Subject: Guggenheim/Enron Event

Hello all,

Over the last few weeks correspondence has been disseminated to you in 
regards to opportunities with the Guggenheim Museum in New York. We need to 
get a more accurate head count if we would like to have a private Enron event 
at the Frank Gehry Exhibit.  Tentatively, we have May 24th on hold and Frank 
Gehry has agreed to be in attendance, which is an added-value. The event 
would be a formal dinner with approximately 150-200 people, including Enron 
executives and their potential/existing customers.  Again, the attendance 
list is created through your requests but Enron Corporate covers the cost of 
the event (excluding travel arrangements).

We need to make a firm commitment to the Guggenheim by Monday.  Please let me 
know approximately how many people you would like to bring by tomorrow. Feel 
free to call me at 39056 or email me if you have any questions.

Thanks, Margaret

Did the Palestinians settle with the Israelis? No.  Did Dan Reeves settle
with John Elway? No.  Did Anna Nicole Smith settle with her in-laws? No.

But Salomon Smith Barney and Enron have settled all the issues and have
agreed to the $50 million credit facility.  The documents are in Mary Cook's
capable hands and should be completed next week.

In addition, I hope that Jon Davis' cooling demand presentation on Wednesday
(3:15) will be valuable for your trading endeavors.  John Galperin (on our
desk) will introduce Jon.  Try to stay awake during John's introduction.

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20

maybe.  hydro situation dire in west.  think water levels are at recent 
historical lows.  problem is from gas standpoint, west is an island right 
now.  every molecle that can go there is.  so will provide limited support to 
prices in east.  hydro in east is actually very healthy.  would assume your 
markets are targeting eastern u.s. so i dont know if hydro problem in west is 
that relevant.

unfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.  the 
question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of 
correcting for violations of the black scholes model.  in my mind, there are 
three big reasons for skew.  one is that the assumption of stochastic 
volatility as a function of price level gets violated.  commodities tend to 
have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and 
elasticity of the demand curve.  nat gas tends to be relatively stable when 
we are in that historical pricing environment.  however, moving to a 
different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.  an options trader wants 
to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the 
range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.  supports a 
vol smile theory.  in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a 
function of price level.  nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at 
$4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.  thus there has been a tendency for all 
calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative 
skew.  the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off 
in a declining market and increase in a rising market.  to test, regress 15 
day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.  
second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution 
predicts.  supports vol smile theory.  easy to test how your market compares 
by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected 
distribution.  
third, is just supply and demand.  in a market where spec players are 
bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance 
premium to add incremetal risk to the book.  if you have a neutral view 
towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly 
fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more 
expensive insurance.  crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak 
call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer 
fences.  if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the 
fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.  
if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.  hope this 
helps,
john

John, Mike

I work for the London Research team and am looking at 
some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.
Dave Redmond the options trader told me that you had done 
some fundamental research regarding 
the gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help.

I would be grateful if you tell me 
what you have done or suggest 
someone else that I could ask.

Jeff,

Two points:  1)  We do not want to tie the deals together in any form of 
written communication.  We must be very careful going down this path. Your 
comment below is very valid.  2) Having said that, we can certainly help 
facilitate putting together an agreement with the understanding that I will 
not put my people through a fire drill.  We need total buy in from all the 
parties.  GSS has already wasted a lot of time on this process.  Let us know 
the next step and Glenn and I will be happy to help with the agreement.

Cheers!

Jennifer and Peter, welcome back...!

Attached are the notes from the EBS team and BMC organization regarding the 
proposals to EBS and Net Works (etc.) from BMC.

I am curious, Peter (or Glenn), if it is reasonable of BMC to make the 
statement to the effect that, "...the 45% discount is applied only if
we have the EBS Enron Partnership agreement in place...".  Is that cutting it 
close on the restraint of trade issue?

Bob McAuliffe has informed me in a note that if his people (Matson & Cumming) 
choose the BMC product at testing conclusion, he would support their 
decision.  Smith and Ogg have given "no go" indications.  I have received 
that information from Bruce Smith in a telephone conversation, but Jim Ogg's 
lack of communication with me is what I have used to draw a similar 
conclusion for his situation...

BMC and EBS both, I believe, are wanting GSS to do the contract work for this 
deal.  It is my understanding, Peter, that the timing of that request might 
be a problem for your guys...Perhaps we should have a quick, informal pow-wow 
about this?

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff,

Attached are all the outstanding deal proposals from BMC.  Lets push for some 
addl discounts so we can get each of these guys a "win".  I have asked our 
BMC contacts to reduce these quotes already due to our partnership but I am 
sure you know how to handle this best.

We need your help Jeff, we cant do it without you.

Thanks,

Hi Steve,

It was nice talking to you.  Included here are the Product quotes that we
sent to the groups.  The Incontrol has multiple spreadsheets for Bruce
Smith's projects.  Real Media is for Everett.  The other two are self
explanatory.

The concern that we have is that there is still not a quote for Jim Ogg and
therefore it is not a quantified amount for the deal we're doing together.
That is significant because it effects discounts, volume, and certainly the
more BMC product that Enron targets the better for this deal.

As mentioned in the phone call, I'll send you a soft copy of the Enron Corp
(which includes EBS) software license agreement with BMC if I can get it for
you.  Otherwise it will be a hard copy when you come over today.  It
includes the terms of liability, warranty, etc.

I look forward to seeing you today.

Best regards,
Ann

		 Subject: The EBS Enron agreement

Hi Jeff,

I hope you are doing well.  There have been some interesting developments on
the way to the Enron Broadband/BMC agreement since we last spoke.
Apparently, it is extremely important to Jim Crowder to get this agreement
in place by December 15.  As a result of the conversation between Jim
Crowder and Jeff Hawn, BMC Exec., I have been directed to help Steve Morse
and Chaz Vaughan in leveraging the best deal possible for the various
projects that Enron is considering with BMC.  As you are aware, we have
already proposed several individual deals.  In addition to those we are
including some deals in which there has been an expressed interest so that
Enron can take advantage of the pricing that this partnership will bring to
you.

The purpose of this e-mail is to give you a heads up on the acceleration of
timing that we have been directed to work towards and to let you know that
we have already agreed to bring our price down in order to make the price
more attractive to Enron.  We would very much appreciate your help in
expediting the process of bringing this agreement to closure.  In my next
e-mail I will send you a list of all the outstanding BMC proposals to Enron.

Hi Jeff,

I'm sure you already realize this, but for the sake of clarification, it's

we have the EBS Enron Partnership agreement in place.

actually
thot it could have been worse so my range pre was 5-12 basis past cupla weeks
aga. that said i with you took my lumps. having a very good month in petro
helped me hold on to natgas shit p&l. got most of it back now tho.trying to be
more patient.
    think we hold 5.20's  for another week or so-must be plenty chopped up
traders mite mean we lose some momentum for a bit.
    what the hell was going on today between you and bo(seems i see this more
and more)? how come he always seems to be fighting you on this stuff. if he
would go the same way as you(and i) this mkt would just crap. either way im
unwinding-gonna be making a jump soon(thats p&c for the moment). will keep u

Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of
the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost
its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.
Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play
that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a
more bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch
out below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the
economy is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint
getting up.

In regards to gas:
what signals do you for in determining your view?
what resources do you use to formulate a price view?
give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer.
where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest 
level we've been at in past 5 years?
what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market?
what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? 
What do you expect in the next 5?
how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given 
day?

In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty
What are delta/gamma/theta?
if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero?
Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts?
If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal?
what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if 
corresponding futures are trading $5?
what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

Jeanie Slone was telling me that you were among the best interviewers in the 
trading group.  Because of your expertise in this area, I was wondering if 
you could help me put some technical questions together that you've found to 
be effective in interviewing Gas Traders.

Norma Hasenjager is in our Omaha office needs this information ASAP in order 
to help her screen some candidates.  It would be great if you could respond 
to this with two or three questions that you've used in the past to select 
good Gas Traders.

Thanks for your help.

Wow, what a week so far.  Beauty of a short squeeze early on.  Even some of 
the biggest bears I know were covering to reestablish when the market lost 
its upward momentum.  Unfortunately, my boat is too big to play that way.  
Takes too long to put the size of the position I manage on or off to play 
that game.  just had to sit back and take my lumps. couldnt have been a more 
bearish aga # in my opinion.  got one more decent one and then watch out 
below.  amazing that we've had more demand destruction recently.  the economy 
is the 800 pound gorilla that is sitting on nat gas and it aint getting up.  Message-ID: <9905502.1075857608283.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

John-

My name is Clayton Vernon, and I am the Manager for Models and Forecasts for 
East Power Trading, reporting to Lloyd Will.

I'm helping Research (and Toim Barkley) with a data visualization tool for 
EOL trades, and I wanted for you to know I'd like to make this product 
helpful for you.

In doing so, I'd like to also let my colleagues Chris Gaskill/Hunter Shively 
avail themsevles of this tool. But, I need to find out if the desks are your 
colleagues or, as things shape up, your competitors, since some trades are 
between Enron desks.

Can Chris/Hunter see synopses of all of our EOL gas trades, after the fact?

All,

In our meeting on the 17th of November, the NetWorks team explained their 
position(s) relative to possible upcoming purchases of software, in which BMC 
might be selected as the vendor.  There were several issues and concerns 
which were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimal 
application capability (that is the "net", understated version).

Bob, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what, if anything, 
BMC could do to "fix their problem".  I relayed the gist of our brief 
conversation to EBS.

As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a deal 
done with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.  One 
of the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMC 
for a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.  Per a 
voicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.

I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for either 
November 30th, or December 1st.  The purpose is to get an update from the 
NetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBS 
to explain what BMC has proposed.  This meeting should take an hour.  

Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow or Friday.  I'll book a room and 
time that works for the majority, and confirm with a Notes "Meeting 
Invitation".

Thank you,

Jeff

Eric, 

Thank you very much for taking the time to speak with Tom Moore and me.  
Attached is the (only) contract which I have received from the EBS 
origination team trying to close a deal with BMC Software.  Steve Morse and 
Chaz Vaughan report to Brad Nebergall (VP, Central Origination, EBS), who 
reports to Jim Crowder (VP, Enterprise Services, EBS).  

Please review, and provide your feedback to me, the EBS origination team 
(Chaz, Steve, and Brad Nebergall), and Tom Moore.  

If there are any other EBS deals/contracts on the table involving BMC, I 
would like to do whatever I could to help them close on this.  Please let me 
know if I can do anything else for you!  You can reach me at (x55968) or Tom 
at (x55552).  The origination team is at (Chaz: x58815, Steve: x37137, Brad: 
x34714).  On a final note, the originators have repeatedly driven home the 
point that they must have this deal closed with BMC by end-of-day this 
Friday, December 15.  I am focused on helping them win the business however I 
can.

Thank you,

Jeff

John - Could you please alert your back office that they are still invoicing
us on a Nov-Mar strip that was traded on June 20, 2000 at $4.105.  That deal
was cancelled per our discussion and rebooked for half the volume in
November (I beleive it was November).  Your deal number on the rebook is
QF9221.1 I beleive.  I beleive Dutch Quigley on your end was involved when
we originally discussed the deal.

Jen and Paula are definitely going to NYC for the long weekend.  Think

Do you want to spend the long weekend with me or do your own thing?
If you want to spend it with me, would you rather go to the beach or

yea,  i think the two dumps in the market are when everybody realizes the 
loss of demand, which is in the first 4 inj numbers.  customer buying and 
fear about the summer will keep may at a decent level.  if my theory holds, 
eventually that wont be enough to hold the market up and m pukes.  second 
puke is in the winter when 4th quarter production is 4-5% on y/y basis, 
demand still weak (economic weakness isn't a 3 month problem), industry 
realizes that not only is it ok to get to 500-700 bcf in march but you

Warming Up To Green

BY ERIC ROSTON

Breathe in. Hold it. Hold it. O.K., now breathe out.

Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are you
can't see
your breath. And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tin
box for the
right to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. Yet last November,
Murphy Oil
Corp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundred
thousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the same
stuff you
exhaled three sentences ago.

The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred that
same autumn
day, half a world away, at the Hague. Thousands of policymakers and
scientists
from all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross the
zeds and
umlaut the o's on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. Framework
Convention on
Climate Change. The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emission
of six
gases, CO2 among them, that are slowly--actually quickly in geological
terms--turning the earth into a hothouse. But no final accord was
reached.

In this context, Murphy's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons of
carbon
(the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,800 cars) from a
Canadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national target
seems a
bit odd. The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, and
there isn't
even a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. Indeed
there
isn't even unanimity on global warming itself.

Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of an
environmental
transition. Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and global
bureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissions
trading
system. But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning to
confront the
climate conundrum the best way they know how--as a business opportunity.
John Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat and
set up
internal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. Shell and BP have
vowed
to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each--nearly twice the Kyoto
target--Shell by 2002, BP by 2010. "This isn't an act of altruism," says
Aidan
Murphy of Shell. "It's a fundamental strategic issue for our business."

And not theirs alone. A growing number of corporations, from IBM to your
neighborhood Kinko's, are reducing their greenhouse footprints. DuPont
is
pledging to knock its emissions 65% below 1990 levels by 2010. "There's
been a
shift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community since
Kyoto," says
Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "Now the view is that
climate
change is serious and we ought to do something about it."

There are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sources
and "cap
and trade" emissions. That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gas
emission
and let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below their
allowance or
buy credits if they exceed permitted levels. The theory is that the
pursuit of
greenbacks will fuel greener business. "Whenever you turn a pollution
cut into a
financial asset," says Joseph Goffman, an attorney at Environmental
Defense,
"people go out and make lots of pollution cuts."

Even where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewing
the
potential for global regulation as a business risk they need to
consider. Witness
Claiborne Deming, Murphy's CEO, who doesn't see the science of global
warming
as solid enough yet to cry havoc. But Deming hears shareholders
clamoring and
the bureaucrats buzzing. Someone may ask his company to put more than a
quarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allotted
amount of CO2.

Breathe in. Hold it. You know the drill.

How much CO2 did you just exhale? Tricky question. Yet that's analogous
to the
one businesses are struggling with on a massive scale. Until they figure
it out,
companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) how
you
buy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2)
how to do
so when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right. "It's risky as
hell," says
Deming.

Many groups are working to mitigate that risk. The World Resources
Institute
and others are road-testing a system that would make trading less risky
by
creating universal carbon-accounting practices. And four
companies--Arthur
Andersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re--are developing an
exchange
where companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid of
legislative
standards. "They're trying to nail down something that will be useful
under laws
that are not yet defined," says Garth Edward, a broker at Natsource, an
energy-trading firm.

The U.S. struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the Kyoto
Protocol,
and achieved it by agreeing to a tough, many say impossible, target:
bringing
emissions 7% below 1990 levels from 2008 to 2012. The irony of the
current
situation is that the Europeans, reluctant to accept trading at first,
have become
its champion; Britain next month will become the first country to embark
on a
national trading system.

Another practice, still hotly debated, is to assign credits for
sequestering carbon
in growing forests. Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2, release oxygen
into the
air and turn carbon into wood.

The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification, thus
setting up
an early environmental test for President Bush, who campaigned against
the
document. But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heard
preliminary
briefings on the matter as the U.S. preps for the next round of talks,
to be held in
Bonn in mid-July. Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in 1990,
when he
signed legislation that capped power plants' sulfur dioxide
emissions--the main
ingredient in acid rain--but allowed the plants to swap credits. And
Houston-based Enron, an energy trader whose chairman, Ken Lay, was a
prominent W. campaign adviser, stands to be a huge player in any such
market.
So if it's good for business, Bush the ex-businessman won't need that
big a push.

With him or without him, the monetization of carbon emissions--green for
greed's sake, if nothing else--is gaining momentum. So breathe easy. For
you, it's
still free. But for many companies, the carbon meter will be running
soon. In the
very near future, pollution is going to be either a cost to them or an
opportunity.

to

Subject: Re: FW: LNG Weekly Update

Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

On Friday, will there be a private reception or area for us or will our 
customers get lost in the crowd?
Probably thinking 30 invites for Friday.  Is that ok?

Hey Buster,

Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
desperately!  

I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!

Thanks honey! Margaret

heffner how?
was pretty long coming into today just playing the range.  sold everything
on the way up.  will be s scale up seller probably through options.
certainly a short squeeze in trade today and i don;t think anything changes
tomorrow except maybe trade gets more confident in the short at the higher
level and if cash rejects higher prices.
will be buying lots of puts on the way up so i guess for me vol is not too
high.  i was short vol and covered it all this morn.  think we could be in
for some turbulence here

Subject: Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - 1st Quarter 2001

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
st=20
two years.  These informal, interactive forums
will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
=20
indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
=20
also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
ts=20
executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
create a=20
=01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
 =01&same=20
page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.

To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:

Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
u=20
will attend only one session.)

______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M

______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M


The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
presentations.=20
? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
questions and express your own opinions.
? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
.
? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
s,=20
projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
=20
values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
o=20
the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20

Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
=20
sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
t=20
choices as much as possible. =20

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20
e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806=
.

Thank you.

Bob,

I want to make sure I keep you in the loop on the EBS/BMC/NetWorks/Global 
Strategic Sourcing interactions.

EBS has worked out an additional 25% discount, which brings the total 
discount structure to Enron to a 45%-off pricing level, if EBS and Enron 
aggregate their spend opportunity.  This should come as good news to anyone 
at Net Works who might be about to implement a BMC solution.  

Also, there is additional flexibility in the situation, in that BMC will be 
willing to work with Enron business units with regard to the timing of their 
software purchases as it relates to applicability in EBS' deal.  For example, 
if Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their 
current testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail 
(or other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 
(the preference would be to get the "buy" done by end of 1st Qtr, if 
possible).  This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with 
their purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC.

I'm going to contact your leads (Randy, Bruce, et. al.) to let them know of 
the additional possible discount and the relative ease of securing it...and 
to also help make sure that what BMC is pricing out to all is the correct 
application solution in each instance.

Thank you for your help and cooperation,

Looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  Obviously the most 
important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative 
to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  
As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year 
and five year averages.  It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis 
were geared the same way.  The fact that lng shipments are x this week is 
meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely 
useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move 
discussion that way.  what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats 
production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.

Andy:
Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming 
online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close 
to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting 
limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this 
framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be 
matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what 
everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the 
industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information 
advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first 
priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a 
counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that 
will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our 
competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL 
markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you 
want to discuss.

John

Redmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with 
regard to EOL for UK gas.
We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a 
considerably greater share of the market. (We estimate 50% now).
Spectron are getting about 20-30% of the number of trades we do. There are 
still some counterparties who insist on paying through our numbers and paying 
brokerage so they do not show us what we are doing!  As far as we are 
concerned we only use SpectronLive on UK gas when we are  executing the 
strategy you mentioned below. 

Once again, thanks for your help
All the best,

Andy

Andy:
Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.
John

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Best regards

On Friday, will there be a private reception or area for us or will our 
customers get lost in the crowd?
Probably thinking 30 invites for Friday.  Is that ok?

Hey Buster,

Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
desperately!  

I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!

Thanks honey! Margaret

Tracy:

FYI:  Yet another important milestone in the relationship between Enron and 
Continental.  Specific opportunities to expand the fuel management 
relationship were explored between Jeff Shankman and Larry Kellner this 
afternoon.  Note the details below.  Also, a tour of the Enron trading floor 
was given to our guests.

Thanks again for your help in initially working with us to establish the 
relationship!

agree with contango story .   cash to futures pretty bullish but a picture 
where agressive inj now are bearish later.  so curve should flatten.  also 
back of curve (cal2,3) under a lot of pressure now.  customers will be buying 
all the way down and will get fucked just like last year.  contango has been 
under considerable pressure even with the front falling...any rally should 
result in those snapping in to 4.  good scalp in my opinion.
definitely seeing your side on the $5 level.  surprised we havent gotten more 
demand back as we sit at these lower levels.  
off to cabo today for a long weekend.  kind of exhausted at work right now so 
a much needed break.

i wud think apr shud also start to find support from contangos, storage 
players,
ie pretty attractive contangos given the bullsih mkt sentiment, and spec a
little short will eventually roll. i bullspd a little little at 5.5 just for a
scalp. if cash converges which it shud as we fall in px then shud see sprds 
find
support at the 5-6 ct level/month? ?
    other than that-im still bearish-5 bucks not sustainable longer term and
nothing yet telling me otherwise. economy and oil curve also not going to help
ngas. buying 4.00 summer puts
  thanks for comments on utilites-i'll bet they buy all the way down but i 
think
theyll have so much gas coming at em if we stay at these levels the mkt will
ultiamtely force em to back down.
  in ny yest and today-saw the red hot chili peppers last nite , was awsome,

Hi John,

I work in Corp. PR and Eric Thode recommended that I drop you and email with 
respect to a question I have about specific trade types that no one seems to 
know the answer to.  I wanted to know if you knew what ST and MLT trades are 
and just so you know, in case it makes a difference, these are in context to 
French power trading.  I know you are extremely busy but if you get a chance 
I would greatly appreciate your comments.

Matt:

As GSS Business Development transitions the HP relationship for broadband to 
your team, there are several issues I wanted to clarify in terms of how the 
relationship has been developed and who the contacts have been to date.  
Additionally, I outlined the discussion points/action items from this 
morning's meeting you held with Jennifer Medcalf and myself.  Per your 
request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP's business 
partners was e-mailed to you this morning.

HP contacts to date: 

Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5587
(Gerry Cashiola's boss)

Gerry Cashiola, sales representative 
Houston, TX
#(713)-439-5555
(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)

Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager
Southeast Region
Austin, TX 
(#(512)-257-5735
(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer 
leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)

Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances
Austin, TX
#(512)-257-5736
(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)

Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions
Cupertino, CA
#(408)-447-5240
(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP's business 
propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value 
propositions.  Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the 
11/16th meeting)

Matt,
 
On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron's 
trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit 
center on the trading floor.  This tour was one meeting, amongst several, 
held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron's 
products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron 
(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).

On November 16th GSS Business Development,  Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark 
outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas  --  connectivity, storage, and 
wireless.  Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:

1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola 
has stalled on providing this).  Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this 
information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short 
term opportunity.  What is HP's time horizon for short term?

2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to 
explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)

3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT 
Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14)   

In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several 
decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:


Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process.  More 
importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews 
of Enron's products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the 
GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been 
unable to define an HP business proposition.  The coordination between 
Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has 
remained unorganized.  These initiatives need to be developed separately.


Clearly,  the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior 
level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship 
forward at a strategic level.  As the relationship is developed at this 
strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way.  But 
Gerry's short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, 
rather a by-product.  To facilitate this process of elevating the 
relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and 
Greg Pyle.  Lovejoy's boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of  HP's America's Central 
Region.

 In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding 
wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS 
initiative by reiterating the following two points:  

 a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP  to move forward on 
the process of building a strategic  relationship  (IBM and Lexmark are only 
some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)

 b) HP's ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP's 
business relationship process with Enron

 Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill 
Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in 
the near term.  Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer 
in person.  


We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and 
other opportunities.

very funny today...during the free fall, couldn't price jv and xh low enough 
on eol, just kept getting cracked.  when we stabilized, customers came in to 
buy and couldnt price it high enough.  winter versus apr went from +23 cents 
when we were at the bottom to +27 when april rallied at the end even though 
it should have tightened theoretically.  however, april is being supported 
just off the strip.  getting word a lot of utilities are going in front of 
the puc trying to get approval for hedging programs this year.

g=20
utilities in other parts of the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.=20
UtiliCorp now serves 4 million customers in seven states and four countries=
.=20
More important, they veered off into other parts of the energy business. In=
=20
1986 they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got=
 a=20
two-person gas-trading operation as part of the deal. That little trading=
=20
operation, now a subsidiary called Aquila, turned into something almost as=
=20
valuable as all the rest of the company, with its 4,500 megawatts of power=
=20
generated in some 22 power plants around the country.=20
"My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be=
=20
competitive in this business," says Bob Green. Oh, yeah? Aquila has 1,100=
=20
employees and competes with the likes of Duke, Dynegy and Enron. According =
to=20
Natural Gas Week, Aquila was the fourth-largest power-and-gas marketer in t=
he=20
country last year. Aquila trades a host of other products as well-everythin=
g=20
from weather-condition hedges to bandwidth.=20
Problem: Trading operations require capital just as power plants do. The=20
solution, until now, has been what brother Bob calls "our 'asset lite'=20
strategy. We want to control the capacity, not own it." So Aquila may provi=
de=20
the gas to power a so-called merchant plant, one that produces electricity =
to=20
sell in the market, in return for a claim on its production. But so far=20
Aquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the=20
business-taking on big risk in larger transactions, the way Enron and Dyneg=
y=20
do.=20
What to do? In mid-December UtiliCorp announced that it would offer 19.9% o=
f=20
Aquila to the public, raising capital while creating a market value for its=
=20
trading operation, just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern=20
Company are doing. The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o=
f=20
20 to 45 times earnings. Then, if all were to go as planned, UtiliCorp woul=
d=20
spin off the rest of the operation in a tax-free distribution.=20
The timing looks good. Aquila has no material exposure in the California=20
market. Furthermore, the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for=
=20
many firms that trade power, including Aquila. Its trading subsidiary is th=
e=20
reason UtiliCorp's earnings were up 28% last year, to $206 million, on $29=
=20
billion in sales. UtiliCorp's shares doubled in the past year to $30.=20
But will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila=
=20
stock offering? It might. And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in=
=20
the capital markets forever. Even with its "asset-lite" strategy, the compa=
ny=20
is far more leveraged than most utilities, with debt at 56% of capital,=20
versus the 50% norm for electric utilities. The offering is supposed to rai=
se=20
$425 million or so that could be used to pay down a bit of the parent's $2.=
9=20
billion in debt.=20
If Bob Green is walking a financial tightrope, you could never tell it by=
=20
talking to him. "We see this company as our heritage," he says confidently.=
=20
This despite the fact that after seven equity offerings the family's share =
of=20
UtiliCorp is now 4%, down from 15% when Richard took over.=20
Might the Greens lose their heirloom in a takeover battle? They might, but=
=20
they might come out ahead anyway. Look at the family history. Lemuel sold=
=20
some of his utility assets for $6.6 million in 1927 and diversified into=20
California orange groves. The assets were resold to Samuel Insull, the=20
midwestern electricity magnate who came to a bad end when his pyramid of=20
holding companies collapsed during the Depression. Years later, after=20
Congress reacted with a law that busted up multistate electric utilities, B=

Two years ago, Bradley Hoggatt was heading for an academic career in=20
meteorology, intent on discovering more about how hurricanes form. But just=
=20
before he started working on a doctorate, a very different opportunity blew=
=20
in.=20
Now Mr. Hoggatt forecasts weather for a floor full of M.B.A.s who trade=20
billions of dollars in weather-sensitive energy commodities such as natural=
=20
gas and electricity for Aquila Inc., the trading subsidiary of a big Midwes=
t=20
utility.
With no business background himself, Mr. Hoggatt is also trading complex=20
financial contracts based on his predictions. "I'm putting my money where m=
y=20
mouth is," says the tall, square-shouldered 28-year-old.=20
Weathermen and women have become a hot commodity in the exploding=20
energy-trading business. While off-target forecasts on television may=20
frustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians, as they did this=
=20
week on the East Coast, they can lose bundles for electricity and natural-g=
as=20
traders. So as trading has boomed, so has demand for trained meteorologists=
,=20
a profession that traditionally hasn't paid all that well and is often the=
=20
butt of jokes.=20
From Wall Street to Houston's Louisiana Street, where many energy companies=
=20
have set up shop, recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a=
t=20
the National Weather Service or in academia. "The appetite for weather is=
=20
insatiable," says James L. Gooding, director of meteorology at Duke Energy=
=20
Corp. A former NASA scientist, Dr. Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast=
er=20
to his Houston team in the next year.=20
Enron Corp., an energy-trading giant based in Houston, has more than double=
d=20
its staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years, plucking=
=20
talent from places like the Weather Channel. Williams Cos., a Tulsa, Okla.,=
=20
competitor, is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students=
.=20
And since 1999, Aquila, which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc., of Kansas=
=20
City, Mo., has hired two other meteorologists from Mr. Hoggatt's alma mater=
,=20
the University of Wisconsin, plus another scientist with a Ph.D. in=20
climatology.=20
That hiring paid off a bit during this week's winter storm in the Northeast=
.=20
While many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a=
=20
pending, possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other=20
cities, traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr. Hoggatt.=20
Last Friday, Scott Macrorie, an electricity trader for the Mid-Atlantic=20
region at Aquila, stopped by to see how the storm was progressing. Mr.=20
Hoggatt's team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low=
er=20
because of the storm, though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little=20
high. Sure enough, temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less=
=20
than predicted, lifting electricity prices and making Mr. Macrorie a profit=
=20
that he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars.=20
About 500 university students in the U.S. graduate each year with bachelor'=
s=20
degrees in meteorology, according to the American Meteorological Society. A=
n=20
additional 300 or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates. Until jus=
t=20
a few years ago, those graduates didn't typically have many options: TV for=
=20
those who had the blow-dried look, back-office jobs with the government or =
a=20
handful of private consultants for those who didn't. Research was an option=
.=20
And some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help=
=20
position airplanes or power-line repair trucks during storms.=20
Now, deep-pocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with=
=20
graduate degrees salaries ranging from $60,000 to $90,000. Performance and=
=20
trading bonuses can double or even triple the figure. That compares with th=
e=20
roughly $33,000 the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with =
a=20
graduate degree.=20
"It's a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative=20
employment after graduation," says John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of=20
atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University. "This is a bit of a switch."=
=20
So far, there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available, partly=
=20
because the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in=
=20
the mid-1990s and slowed hiring. It hires only to replace people who leave,=
=20
about 30 to 50 meteorologists a year.=20
And the high-pressure world of billion-dollar commodity bets isn't for=20
everyone. When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State, one of the nation's to=
p=20
meteorology programs, he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron. "It's quite an=
=20
impressive place," he says of Enron's trading floor, but he wasn't sure=20
forecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade. "I would be=20
afraid that if money wasn't made in a hurry, I'd be tossed," says Mr. Altoe=
,=20
who accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette, Mic=
h.=20
For others, having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art. After=
=20
two years as a manager at the Weather Channel's Latin American division in=
=20
Atlanta, Jose Marquez posted his resume on an Internet job site run by the=
=20
American Meteorological Society. Enron called.=20
"Have you heard about Enron?" Mr. Marquez remembers being asked. "And I sai=
d,=20
honestly, `No.'"=20
During a visit, Mr. Marquez, a 33-year-old Navy-trained meteorologist, foun=
d=20
Enron's trading floor exhilarating. Enron courted Mr. Marquez heavily,=20
tracking him down three times during his Christmas vacation in Puerto Rico.=
=20
Mr. Marquez decided the sprawling trading floor was just the sort of active=
=20
work place he was looking for. Also, he'd be getting a 10% to 15% boost ove=
r=20
his Weather Channel salary, before potential bonuses from Enron.=20
"I'm getting more money than I would anywhere else," he says.=20
Weather has long affected prices of everything from grain at Chicago's earl=
y=20
commodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on Wall Street. Jon=20
Davis, a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago, started=20
forecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in 1985.=20
But volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are=
=20
able to gauge air-conditioning use in the summer or natural-gas demand duri=
ng=20
the winter heating season. Meanwhile, all sorts of companies are turning to=
=20
energy traders and Wall Street for "weather derivatives," complex contracts=
=20
used to hedge financial risks associated with the weather. "With every=20
passing year, you do more energy and more energy," Mr. Davis says.=20
Despite big advances in data collection and modeling, betting millions of=
=20
dollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business. Short-term=20
forecasts are pretty good. Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy.=
=20
Most meteorologists get their data from the government, particularly the=20
National Weather Service. Many then tweak it with their own interpretations=
=20
or forecasting models.=20
Disappointed last year by poor long-term forecasts from 11 private=20
consultants, Aquila has a contest offering $100,000 to the meteorologist or=
=20
team that can best predict temperatures in 13 major U.S. cities over the=20
course of a year. "I call it the forecast bakeoff," says Mr. Hoggatt.=20
The high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters. WSI Corp., a=20
Billerica, Mass., weather-forecasting firm, started an energy service last=
=20
year, and Jeffrey A. Shorter, a WSI vice president, says energy clients can=
=20
be less forgiving than his other clients in TV and aviation, especially whe=
n=20
the forecasts are wrong. But, he adds, "presumably, more often than not,=20
we're right."

ENRON PROVIDES TRADING SERVICES TO MANX ELECTRICITY UNDER NETA
2001-03-08 08:43 (New York)


     (The following is a reformatted version of a press release issued
by Enron and received via electronic mail. The release was not confirmed
by the sender.)

ENRON AND MANX ELECTRICITY ANNOUNCE POWER TRADING AGREEMENT

     London, March 8 -- Enron announced today that it has concluded a
long-term power trading agreement with the Manx Electricity Authority
(MEA), representing one of the first deals with an embedded generator
specifically designed for the New Electricity Trading Arrangements
(NETA). Under the agreement Enron will provide 24-hour trading services
to MEA under NETA in an innovative deal structured to maximise the value
of the electricity interconnector between the Isle of Man and UK
mainland.
     The =01A45 million interconnector runs between Bispham in Lancashire
and Douglas on the Isle of Man and is capable of carrying 40MW in each
direction. At 105km it is the longest AC interconnector cable in the
world.
     "The development costs of the interconnector to the UK placed us
under pressure to put the link to the highest and best economic use and
we feel our relationship with Enron has accomplished this" said Mike
Proffitt, Chief Executive of MEA.
     "Our commitment to reducing the price of electricity on the Isle of
Man is firmly embedded in MEA's five year plan and our trading
partnership with Enron will greatly assist us in achieving this goal."
     Richard Lewis, Managing Director of UK gas and power at Enron,
commented: "This is a great transaction for both parties and fits well
into Enron's trading portfolio. MEA will benefit from Enron's expertise
as one of the UK's leading energy traders and will provide us with their
skills as operators of their generation plant and the interconnector. It
is significant in that we believe it is one of the first embedded
generation transactions specially tailored for the new trading
arrangements."

Energy Trading Companies Pay Big for Weather Talent, WSJ Says
2001-03-08 06:47 (New York)


     Kansas City, March 8 (Bloomberg) -- The growth of energy
trading floors in the past several years has made meteorology a
glamour profession, even for forecasters who never even intended
to predict the weather on television, the Wall Street Journal
reported.
     Weather affects commodities trading and determines
electricity and natural gas supply and demand. That's why large
energy trading companies like Enron Corp., Williams Cos. and
UtiliCorp United Inc. recruit top weather-forecasting talent, the
paper said. Meteorologists with graduate degrees can command
$60,000 to $90,000 a year, far higher than the $33,000 the
National Weather Service pays a junior staffer.
     Energy traders use in-house weather forecasts to make quick
bets on the direction of electricity and natural gas prices. Fast
and accurate predictions can earn huge profits, the paper said.
     Many meteorologists say they like the pace and action of the
trading floor. While some in the profession work in broadcasting,
most meteorologists labor in the less visible and action-oriented
worlds of academia or government research, the paper said.

SINGAPORE: PetroChina plans five gas, products lines by 2005.
By Chen Aizhu

SINGAPORE, March 8 (Reuters) - PetroChina has mapped out plans for a massiv=
e=20
pipeline gridwork to be in place by 2005 and to ship huge hydrocarbon=20
reserves in China's west to its thriving east, government and industry=20
officials said on Thursday.=20
"A total of five pipelines are planned in the 10th five-year plan=20
(2001-2005), four gas and one for refined oil products," a senior industry=
=20
official told Reuters by telephone from Beijing.
Officials estimated total cost of the projects at 50 billion yuan ($6=20
billion) at least.=20
Topping the agenda and the largest of the five projects is the 4,200-km gas=
=20
trunk line winding eastwards from China's central Asian region Xinjiang to=
=20
the Yangtze River Delta.=20
Construction of the $4.8-billion project is set to start later this year.=
=20
Officials said construction would begin with the 1,600-km eastern section=
=20
from Jinbian in northwest Shaanxi province to Shanghai, where initial gas=
=20
supply is expected to land in 2003.=20
The longer western section connecting Tarim to Jinbian is slated for=20
completion by 2005, officials said.=20
PetroChina aims to move between 12 and 20 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas=
=20
through the trunkline in 2005.=20
HUGE UNTAPPED RESERVES=20
Officials estimated about 720 bcm of recoverable gas reserves remain in the=
=20
Shan-Gan-Ning and Tarim basins. PetroChina's most recent big discovery in t=
he=20
Sulige field in the northern Ordos basin has proven reserves of 220 bcm.=20
PetroChina is hoping to lure foreign firms to invest in the project,=20
including top three oil majors ExxonMobil , Royal/Dutch Shell Group and BP=
=20
Amoco .=20
Also under planning is a three bcm-per-year gas pipeline from Jinbian to=20
Beijing, Hebei and Shandong. Sources said Shell and PetroChina were jointly=
=20
studying the project.=20
A third gas line is planned from Zhongxian in the gas-rich southwest Sichua=
n=20
to Wuhan and Hunan provinces in central China, officials said.=20
U.S. gas and electricity firm Enron Corp is a joint developer in the Sichan=
=20
gas block, which will send supplies via the proposed 740-km line.=20
Sichuan, which produced 7.995 bcm of gas in 2000, is presently China's top=
=20
gas producer, according to official data.=20
The fourth gas pipe, stretching 953-km eastwards from Qaidam basin to Lanzh=
ou=20
in the northwest, is expected to be operational in May with an annual=20
capacity of two bcm, according to Beijing-based industry newsletter China=
=20
OGP.=20
The project, which targets PetroChina's subsidiary refineries in Lanzhou,=
=20
will cost 2.25 billion yuan, China OGP said.=20
LONGEST PRODUCTS LINE TO MOVE OIL SOUTH=20
PetroChina also is set to build a 1,247-km refined products pipeline from=
=20
Lanzhou to oil-thirsty Sichuan to move surplus products out of the remote=
=20
northwest region.=20
A feasibility study for the line, which would be the longest products=20
pipeline in China, was approved recently, a senior official with the State=
=20
Development Planning Commission told Reuters from Beijing.=20
Officials said the project would replace rail transport and eventually cut=
=20
PetroChina's oil distribution cost.=20
"The railway system has a bottleneck which only allows a limited oil flow a=
t=20
one time, and it's much more expensive (than pipeline)," said a Beijing-bas=
ed=20
PetroChina official.=20
When built in 2005, PetroChina would be supplying five million tonnes a yea=

of mostly gasoline and diesel to Sichuan, one of China's most populous=20
province and which buys most of its oil by rail or ship from neighbouring=

Steve/Chaz - 

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point.  

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc.  In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the 
"accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Your 
note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

I will call you to follow up on this note.

Thank you,

confused... what are you disagreeing with me in regards to demand destruction?

cc:  
Subject: rebuttal

I am definitely a bigger fan of the crude complex for the next few months. 
Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand 
destruction. 
? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- 
Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are 
underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy 
is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is 
changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power 
demand as a result of  Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on 
what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying 
is  that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries 
will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure 
in service industries.
? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock-- they couldn't have 
imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly 
entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. 
Also they will  budget for these prices instead of $2.50
? See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos --- 
increases of 20%. When asked the implication for missed earnings and their 
plans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the 
bright lights business'
? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom
 First of all no one wants a repeat of the 1990 recession ( which was much 
worse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates 
this week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar 
which will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will 
not tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction 
in big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this 
is not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming 
more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the 
whole story.
? Finally, I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here.

well there's my 2 cents.

   (Recasts, adds details)
    WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. electricity demand
will grow by about 2.3 percent in 2001, down from 3.6 percent
growth last year due to the nation's slowing economy, the U.S.
Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday.
    Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent this
year, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report.
Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S.
electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal.
    U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was
forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIA
said. That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwh
forecast by the agency last month.
    For the entire winter heating season of October through
March, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent
from the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was driven
by the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecst
to be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively.
    More electricity plants were expected to switch from
natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, the
government report said.
    "This trend is expected to continue through the first
quarter 2001," the EIA said. "Although the favorable price
differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue
through the forecast period, by the second half of 2001,
expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keep
gas demand for power generation growing."
    The monthly report also said that mild weather has eased
natural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gas
supply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricity
plants.
    California has been fighting all winter to maintain

theres only one thing i can think of...   storage field turning around gives 
cash market completely different feel.   instead of utilities looking to sell 
gas everday, they look to buy it.  huge difference in feel of mrket.  not so 
much actual gas but completely different economics of how marginal mmbtu gets 
priced.  tightening cash market causes cash players to buy futures... hence 
the tendency for a spring rally every year.  read heffner today...even he 
talks about it

ECONOMIC VIEW
Utility Deregulation: Square Peg, Round Hole?
By JOSEPH KAHN

03/04/2001
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- IN the forensic pursuit of what caused California's power 
failure, the Bush administration, the energy industry and many analysts have 
granted immunity to deregulation. 
Robert Shapiro, a managing director of Enron, the giant electricity marketer, 
says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other 
states, ''because California didn't really deregulate.'' Spencer Abraham, the 
new energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a 
''dysfunctional'' system. It is the way California deregulated, not 
deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.
Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate 
about whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn, 
the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free 
markets in the rail, trucking and airline industries. 
''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,'' Mr. Kahn said. 
He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain 
the whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism. 
''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,'' he 
said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power 
company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. ''It may be one 
industry in which it works reasonably well.'' 
Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter 
administration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and 
politically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses 
is part of the Washington economic canon. 
Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its 
electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To 
satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which 
soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went 
on the auction block. 
Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power 
on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might 
have allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it 
impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs. 
Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopeful 
that the kinks can be ironed out. 
In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, 
Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, 
regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found 
ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and 
charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said. 
Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price 
signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so 
that they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and 
price spikes can substantially raise average prices. 
''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do 
it here,'' Mr. Joskow said. 
Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices. 
Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure 
Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another. 
''The political system must rise to the task,'' Mr. Joskow said, or the ''old 
way might be the best we can do.'' 
Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the New 
York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated 
industries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic 
tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which 
consumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that 
competition would slash prices. 
But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline 
prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities 
of electricity, Mr. Kahn said. 
Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep 
prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical 
integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn 
said. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal 
ways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them 
to be built. ''The players all depended on one another,'' he said. 
California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made 
people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for 
widgets.

WASHINGTON -- Three corporate executives are under consideration to lead the 
Air Force, Army and Navy, administration officials said Saturday. 
The three have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce this week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, the Washington Times reported, quoting 
unidentified sources.
Gordon R. England, 63, who retired recently from General Dynamics Corp., 
would be nominated as Navy secretary; James G. Roche, 61, a vice president at 
Northrop Grumman Corp., is the pick to head the Air Force; and the choice to 
head the Army is Thomas E. White, 57, a retired Army general and an executive 
with Enron Corp. White also once worked as an assistant to Colin L. Powell, 
Bush's secretary of State.

WASHINGTON--Three corporate executives are under consideration to lead the 
Air Force, Army and Navy, administration officials said yesterday. 
The three men have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and 
the White House was expected to announce next week that it will send their 
names to the Senate for confirmation, The Washington Times reported 
yesterday, quoting unidentified sources.
But two Bush administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told 
The Associated Press that President Bush has not made a decision and that the 
nominations were not a certainty. 
The Times said Gordon England, 63, who retired last week as a vice president 
at General Dynamics, would be nominated as Navy secretary. England was 
responsible for the company's information systems and international programs. 
The newspaper also said James Roche, 61, a vice president at Northrop 
Grumman, was the pick to head the Air Force. Roche, a retired Navy captain, 
worked in the State Department during the Reagan administration and later was 
Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
The nominee for Army secretary was said to be Thomas White, 57, a retired 
Army general and an executive with Enron, a Houston-based energy company. 
White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell 
was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Enron's Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain / Critics regard Kenneth Lay as 
deregulation opportunist
David Lazarus
Chronicle Staff Writer

03/04/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A1
(Copyright 2001)

Kenneth Lay is one of the energy "pirates" accused by California's governor 
of fleecing consumers. As chairman of Enron Corp., the world's largest energy 
trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. 
But that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking 
knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy 
mess.
"It's very unfair," Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality. 
"He's trying to vilify us. But we didn't make the rules in California. We had 
nothing to do with creating the problem." 
He gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston's downtown 
skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky. 
"Everyone played by the rules," Lay said. "Now our reputations are being 
maligned." 
In a sense, he's right. The ultimate blame does rest with California 
policymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such a 
ham-fisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting 
loopholes in the system. 
But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process. 
"Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for 
deregulation in California," said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst 
in the Austin office of Consumers Union. "A lot of what's happening in 
California was their idea." 
Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said Enron was 
especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where 
wholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent 
System Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid. 
"This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor," said 
John Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded as 
the godfather of California's bungled deregulation measures. 
"Enron isn't in the business of making markets work," Rozsa said. "They're in 
the business of making a buck." 
In an ironic twist, however, Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping 
the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company has 
that much clout. 
SEEKING LAY'S BLESSING 
Thus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission 
lines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to call 
recently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan. 
This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had 
been castigated by Davis in the governor's State of the State speech. 
"I told him we couldn't support it," Lay said, a hint of a smile playing 
across his lips. "It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid 
and, longer term, it could make things worse." 
Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enron's big cheese? 
Simple: Davis will need the Bush administration's backing to make the 
power-line sale fly, and, many believe, there's no faster way to reach the 
new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron. 
Lay, 58, and his company have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years, and he placed Enron's private jet at 
Bush's disposal during the presidential race. 
So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is now 
serving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as 
he sees fit. 
"There's a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political 
relationships to get what it wants," said Craig McDonald, director of Texans 
for Public Justice, a watchdog group. "What Ken Lay thinks energy policy 
should be isn't very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it 
should be." 
ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
Lay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his close 
rapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited 
the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months. 
"I have known the president and his family for many years," Lay said. "I've 
been a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in his 
policies." 
He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are 
"grossly exaggerated." 
Still, it is striking that Bush's quick decision after taking office to limit 
federal assistance in solving California's energy woes virtually mirrored 
Lay's own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration's 
hands-off approach to resolving the crisis. 
Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to Enron's bottom 
line. The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year. 
They haven't hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay package 
more than tripled last year to $18.3 million. 
Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company's 
California earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Lay 
conceded that Enron's profit from California energy deals last year was "not 
inconsequential." 
"We benefit from the volatility," he said. 
CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE 
That's putting it mildly. It could be said that California's energy mess was 
tailor-made for Enron, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a 
captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are 
simultaneously soaring skyward. 
To understand why that is, one must look closely at Enron's complex business 
model. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy 
deals. 
Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy 
regulator, set about completely reinventing Enron in 1985 after taking over 
what was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator. 
As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of 
energy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas 
is needed -- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time. 
Enron is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage 
to consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers 
and sellers throughout the country. 
It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually 
creative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas 
prices up, Enron might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in return 
for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants. 
Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the 
proceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it 
ships back to the original utility. 
"We do best in competitive markets," Lay said. "These are sustainable 
markets." 
TRADING FRENZY 
Enron's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly 
young, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of 
the best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost 
frat-party atmosphere. 
The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an 
Internet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $336 
billion, making Enron by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity. 
Kevin Presto, who oversees Enron's East Coast power trades, called up the 
California electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks, 
he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at 
$250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275. 
"Some days we're at $250, some days $300 and some days $500," Presto said 
over the steady thump-thump of the trading floor's rock 'n' roll soundtrack. 
"There's truly a problem out there." 
This is a recurring theme among Enron officials: California's electricity 
market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down. As 
Lay himself put it, "The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace." 
In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isn't just 
making piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going. 
LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA 
The company's energy services division, which handles the complete energy 
needs of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of 
California and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., and 
even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park. 
Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market 
values. At the same time, Enron sells power to PG&E at sky-high wholesale 
levels. 
In other words, Enron is buying back its own electricity from PG&E for just a 
fraction of the price it charges the utility. 
"These guys are the pariahs of the power system," said Nettie Hoge, executive 
director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. "Why do we need 
middlemen? They don't do anything except mark up the cost." 
To be fair, energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient 
marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers. 
This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where Enron actively trades among 
about 200 market participants. 
But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like Enron can 
easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceived 
regulatory framework. 
Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state 
committee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame Enron and other 
power companies for pursuing profits in California. 
"California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules 
California set up," he said. "At the end of the day, they will behave to 
enhance their bottom lines." 
But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next 
year, Turner said he has learned from California's experience -- and is 
taking steps to prevent Texas' power giants from shaking down local 
consumers. 
LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE 
He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission 
more authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies are 
fighting the legislation as hard as they can. 
Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what California 
officials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power 
by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher. 
"I have that concern," he said. "I don't necessarily take these companies at 
their word." 
For his part, Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated 
electricity prices. 
"I don't know of any of that," he said. "It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories." 
As a sign of Enron's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Lay 
said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power 
contracts on behalf of utilities. 
So how many contracts has Enron signed? 
Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and a 
harder, more steely look glinted from his eyes. 
"None," he said. "We won't be signing until we're certain about recovering 
our costs." 
Consider this a shot across California's bow.

Enron boss says he's not to blame for profits in energy crisis

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely from 
California's energy crisis, but Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says he 
shouldn't be a scapegoat in California's energy crisis. 
That hasn't swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such as 
Houston-based Enron for selling expensive power to California.
"Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians 
hostage," Davis warned in his State of the State address. 
More recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state 
looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities. 
"I told him we couldn't support it," Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in 
an interview at his Houston office. "It will lead to an even less efficient 
transmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse." 
Lay is not just any private-sector energy czar - Enron Corp. is the world's 
largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Lay 
and his corporation have donated more than $500,000 to Bush's various 
political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enron's 
private jet during the presidential race. 
But Lay said it's economics, not politics, that matter in California's energy 
crisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energy 
brokers for the protracted problems. 
"We didn't make the rules in California," Lay said. "We had nothing to do 
with creating the problem." 
The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of the 
power industry in 1996. Enron encouraged deregulation, and the state's 
ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation. 
Enron's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to 
$101 billion. Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16 
million in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared 
with less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999. 
Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off California's crisis, though he 
conceded the profit was "not inconsequential." 
"We benefit from the volatility," said Lay, who took over Enron in 1985 and 
has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of 
electricity as a commodity. 
But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by 
insisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep 
the lights on in recent months. 
"I don't know of any of that," he said. "It's so easy to conjure up 
conspiracy theories."

The Stadium Curse? / Some stocks swoon after arena deals
Kathleen Pender

03/04/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
B1
(Copyright 2001)

Is buying the name of a big-league stadium the kiss of death for a company, 
or does it only seem that way? 
From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field 
outside Boston, the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies 
whose stocks have been sacked.
The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after 
PSINet, whose stock has fallen 92 percent to $1.25 a share since it bought 
naming rights. 
The problem names are not all tech. 
The owners of the TWA Dome in St. Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are 
looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt. 
TWA is an airline. Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom. 
The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if 
Edison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison, 
runs out of juice. 
Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens 
or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a 
ballpark or arena. 
In fact, many were at their peak. 
Which begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which 
they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights? 
Brian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders if 
companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the "Sports Illustrated 
curse." It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI 
magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle. 
Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.com Chief 
Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine's 1999 person of the 
year just before his company's stock price tanked. 
Don Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn't 
think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals. 
"You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming 
rights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peak 
in its business," says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham 
Group in Denver. 
TRACKING NAMING FIRMS 
To find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of 
publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league 
sports venues in North America. 
I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, including 
Miller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and Pac 
Bell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications, 
which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio). 
I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals 
are, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generates 
tons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is 
negative and even if the stadium won't open for several years. 
Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard & 
Poor's 500 index during the same period. 
The bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names 
are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced, 
according to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each bought 
two names and were counted twice.) 
But -- and this is a big but -- only 13 of them beat the S&P 500 during the 
period since their respective deals were announced. 
So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee the 
company will beat the market. 
WINNERS, LOSERS 
The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide 
variety of industries. 
The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company. 
Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746 
percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium. 
The next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecom 
equipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) and 
Enron (energy). 
The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI 
(Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network 
Associates (network security software). 
Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming 
rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 1998. Since then, it has suffered 
a string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned 
its accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 1997 and 
1998. Its CEO resigned in December. 
Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the 
coliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years. 
The company "has been paying us," says Deena McClain, general counsel with 
the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. "We haven't had any 
discussions with them" about changing the contract. 
Most naming-rights contracts have "out clauses that allow the parties to 
extricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial 
difficulties or if a team moves," says Hinchey. 
Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may 
benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early. 
That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 1990s, 
when $1 million a year -- give or take -- was average. 
In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of 
the Washington Redskins. 
In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $114 million over 15 years to have its name on 
the new home of the New England Patriots. It's questionable what kind of 
shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year. 
The "10-gallon hat of naming rights deals," says Hinchey, is in Houston, 
where Reliant Energy will pay $300 million over 32 years to name the 
Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself. 
Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal 
was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates. 
Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a 
stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends. 
But Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, "you have to 
look at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It sounds 
like big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years. If you take out 
things the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it's 
small potatoes." 
WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH 
The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game 
is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print. 
"This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding," says Jennifer 
Keavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal. 
She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, "won't even buy you a 
Super Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised 
football game, maybe." 
The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 880, also acts like a giant billboard 
for the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports. 
Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site 
exposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might 
offer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers. 
Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name 
because they sell consumer products or services. 
But not always. 
3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to 
Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 1995. 
"It was a good move for them," says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from 
Sports Venues. "They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility 
they were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field, 
and they wanted to look like a fun place to work." 
Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years. 
The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility 
will be a loser. 
"Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and 
hospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not 
performing well," Hinchey says. "But corporations realize the team's success 
on the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in the 
dumps." 
The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium 
owners -- be they taxpayers or business tycoons -- must realize when they 
sell a name.

So my point shown a little bit right now..  Weather a little cooler for this 
week.  Overall normal for 6-10.  JV up 12 cents.  Think just as customers got 
totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all 
the way down.  Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the 
length.  This year trade not ready to get really short.  Not until healthy 
inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short, 
just question of what and when.  Think there'll be enough hedging demand to 
keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.   
With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going 
to dictate prices for next couple months.  I think it will be spec and 
hedgers dictating.  Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.  
Leads to more upside potential in short term.  
My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell 
side leading to pressure on those spreads.  The california term power sales 
have totally changed that.  Before, the only thing customers were selling was 
cal 2.  Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from 
california.  Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.  You have very valid points.   
i like q/v more though.  I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that 
with little downside.  Thoughts?Message-ID: <33334721.1075857610395.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

so according to your analysis, had we been at $2.5 gas and we were not 
bordering on a recession, we would have had the highest AGA number of 
recorded history for this week, last week, or next week by 15 bcf?  seems a 
little far fetched to me.  Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have 
had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.  that includes commercial residential 
industrial switching processing...    
as far as 2 bcf/d  power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was 
extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be 
running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 
5% still and hydro way down.  every molecule that can will flow west from 
waha this summer versus little last year.  east power prices really havent 
reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where 
gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.  some concern of 
more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.  we're trying to build 
the stack now to estimate.  
frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.  will 
continue coming back.  a little concerned about 2 oil prices.  bordering 
right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 
100,000 last week as gas got to parity.  
let me look into inj capability.  definitely bigger when field is empty from 
engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen 
demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.
bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.  really 
inactive.
to clarify, not raging bull.  i like everybody want to see what the inj 
numbers in april look like.  nobody putting a position on until that starts 
to clarify.  just think that hedging demand is making market a little short 
right now making next move up more likely.  would be scale up seller though
not really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.  doesnt make any sense.  
however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to 
great in my opinion to keep spread there.  must close one way or the other.  
notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?
in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.  50 
cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.  
market needs to see some big stg numbers first.   
i think the best play right now is to start buying longer  term put spreads.  
Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.  if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last 
year's early weather, bombs away.

this doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requires
power px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient,
weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak in
july-shud be marginal in apr-jun
   if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction is
implied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys 
like
me turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will be
less factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&d swing will
be closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i think
we'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner
     now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.00 ie february which is approx 
where
we are today
    all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i consider
extraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occured
before-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ie
liquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. some
ammonia/fert prod  has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/d
industrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as mucha
unction of an economic slowdown.
    anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your 
big
fund customers(ospraie). we'll see.  is collins bullish as well-he seems 
quieter
in the mkt lately.
  heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection is
on a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 then
means the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi and
be unable to inject all the gas available? thots
    also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ct
discount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it 
bt
wondering if its transportation or storage cost related.
  have a good weekdn my man

 if all these are done add them to the summary sheet in usable formula

then we start our price data base from bloom berg

check this out-using the regression you did for nov-march 99/00 came to a draw

Jennifer,
I gave Mike Horning a call I received his e-mail.   He is following up with 
Cox directly to find out what is happening on the broadband side 
(negotiations with Blockbuster).  

I reviewed Universal's request for a sponsorship (of JPI).  He was also 
asking dollar amounts for the sponsorship.  It looks like Mike is going to 
probe Daphne Harvey (Universal) for the technical knowledge he needs in order 
to make the best pitch to Universal.  It looks like he will also feel out the 
organizational structure to see if his contacts are the right ones.

Colleen, 

As part of my strategy, I want to glean information.    Hopefully it will 
give me an understanding of their process and goals, so that I may be more 
effective in my discussions with their media group.

Following are a few questions I will ask Daphne (I don't expect Daphne to 
have all the answers):

1) Help me understand how Universal wants to save money on advertising?
2) Who at Universal is driving that process?  (Names, Titles, etc.)
3) What are the saving targets? (% or $ amount)
4) Where do they want to save in regards to advertising? (Spot TV, Network 
TV, Cable, Radio, NP, etc.)
5) What is their annual advertising budget?  (Per film? Metric? Per media, 
etc.)
6) How much does she understand about media buying? (GRP's, CPM's, Demos, 
Dayparts, Reach & Frequency, etc.)
7) What is her role in this process?
 
I'm sure I will have a few more questions, as we speak with each other.

I think you need to check your AGA model.  7.2 bcf/d seems awfully high.  
That's saying that had gas been at $2.5, the AGA for the week would have been 
151.  Look at the AGA history for last week, this week and next week.

   94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 
3rd week of Feb  -64 -46 -64 -63 -77 -97 -136 -81
4th week of Feb  -132 -118 -62 -76 -47 -128 -74 -101 
1st week of Mar  -27 -132 -118 -57 -54 -69 -37 ??

Do you really think the # would have been 151 with no demand destruction?  It 
wasn't even really cold.  That would have been the highest AGA # of the three 
weeks by 15 bcf.  
Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.  Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 
3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if 
any.  Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of 
Feb.  Assuming that gets to equilibrium:  2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d 
more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.  Start with a 400 b 
deficit and 200 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in 
current price environment.   I think we are fairly priced fundamentally, but 
with huge customer imbalance for hedging from buy side, surprises in the 
market right now are to the upside in my view.  Course hard to imagine $6 for 
J.   Just sell vol.

my next aga number is 75-sllitely more than pira and assumes 7.2 bcf/d y on y
s&d swing-the higher prices now the uglier it'll be later.
contmaplating buying some 4.00 puts for lat 2nd q or early 3q for a few 
pennies.
so whaen we go above last years stx in may!!

beleive it or not pero been worse chop fest than gas-all i know is going to
steamboat co skiing next wed-sunday with mans refined prod groups next week so
taking postion down to the stuff i really like, dont have to worry too much

industrial demand the scary thing.  no question there are some steel mills 
and auto factories and plastics plants that were on last november that arent 
coming up now and its not due to gas prices.  the economy sucks and it will 
affect ind demand.

at least a myn dollars-need to talk to pira on that. excellant point. need to 
do
some margin analyses . having said all that look at corporate earnings from 
last
year to this year regardless of natgas costs as a feed industrials will be
running slower and consumers just now feeling the pinch as rate increases have
only just recently gotten approved and passed to the likes of us and people 
less
fortunate than us.

but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning
of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up
a lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand
will there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if
you can answer that.

off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day
swing y
on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their
feet and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes
as
current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is
no-not
unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q.
 remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started
only 6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full
swing.
we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the
summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring
a
greenhouse in the ohio valley
    good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon
and ill
keep you posted.

but that's my point.  the demand destruction roared its ugly head beginning 
of Jan.  The price level was $9.  Of course there is a lag.  Let's make up a 
lag time...say one month.   On Dec 1 cash was trading $6.70.  Probably a 
similar lag on the way down.  Cash is $5.20 today.  How much lost demand will 
there be in a month if we're still $5.2?   million dollar question if you can 
answer that.

off the cuff i wud say tho same goes for 5.00 gas-currently 6-7 bcf/day swing 
y
on y too much, to buy this level you need to take the view that industrial
america and residential and end users will be able to get back on their feet 
and
recocover a lion share of the 4-4.5 bcf/d demand destruction(this assumes as
current. very little if any dist fuel switching. i think the answer is no-not
unless the economy was jump starter quickly-2nd q is gone,so maybe th 4q.
 remember the demand destruction and industrial shit really just started only 
6
weeks ago-me thinks it will take longer than that to get back into full swing.
we all trade the y on y gap...all things remaining equal(ie term px for the
summer), starting april we'll have a surplus the other way by july barring a
greenhouse in the ohio valley
    good to hear your view pt as always-even if it is wrong!!! ha

Good to hear from you.
After a great F, had an okay G.  Held a lot of term length on the
risk/reward play.  Figured if we got no weather, all the customer and
generator buying would be my stop.  It was.  Amazing that for the drop in
price in H, the strips have really gone nowhere.  just a big chop fest.
i here your arguments, but think they are way exagerated.  Agree with 1.5-2
bcf/d more supply. Call it 2 with LNG.  Imports from Canada should be
negligible.  Now let's assume price for the summer is $4.  No switching,
full liquids extraction, methanol and fertilizer running.  Electric
generation demand, considering problems in west and very low hydro, around
1.5 bcf/d greater this year with normal weather.  Means you have to price 2
bcf/d out of market.  Don't think $4 does that.  What level did we start
really losing demand last year?  It was higher than 4.   concerned about
recession in industrial sector thats occuring right now.
Think gas is fairly valued here.  Dont think we're going to 7.  But I think
fear of market considering what happened this past year will keep forward
curve very well supported through spring.  we're already into storage
economics so the front goes where the forward curve wants to go.

its been a while-hope all is well. not a great few weeks for me in ngas-not
awful just nothing really working for me and as you know got in front of
march/apr a cupla times, no disasters.
   well im bearish-i hate to be so after a 4 buck drop but as i said a
month ago
to you-and now pira coming around. 5.00 gas is a disaster for the natgas
demand.
now production up strongly y on y...you guys agree on the production side?
  i know youve been bullish the summer-think im stll in the minority-but
here
you go, we have y on y supplly up 2/bcf+ demnad loss 3.5bcf/d, 5.5 bcf/day
y on
y swing . then i submit as we started to see due huge rate increases R/C
demandd
energy conservation will be even more dramatic this summer which will
effect
utilty demand/power demand ulitmately.  if pira rite we lost 1.56 in jan
for
this factor i say it cud be bigger this summer as ute loads increase, power
pxes
rise and consumers become poorer. there will be more demand flexibilty in
the
summer part in the midcon and north as AC is more of a luxury item than
heat. i
say 5-6% lower use in residentail/utilty power consumption due rationing is
another .7/1bcf/d loss.
  put all this together we wud build an addional 1284 apr thru oct on top
of
last years 1715  build basis last year temps and todays prices. takes us to
3.6
tcf or so. what am i missing my man-summer has to go to 4 bucks or lower to
restore demand??? thots.

as far as that other thing, the p&c its still alive, shud know more soon

keep you posted.

Would prefer a stand alone button as sometimes the problem is I can't operate 
stack manager.  I need the ability to force everybody out of the website so 
people don't try to click numbers that are old.  

On a similar topic, what's the status of the out of credit message?  Still a 
very frustrating problem for both counterparties and me.  

Do I need to follow up with Bradford about lowering sigma?

Grab me Thursday afternoon to talk.

I asked them to permission on your stack manager this function. You might 
want to have it as a stand alone icon on your desktop in case you can't 
operate stack manager.

When you have a second I'd like to talk about the broker EOL product and ED F 
Man.

Congrats on a big day. Total EOL gas volume was 425BcF (!!).

John -

I completely understand your point of view.  PaineWebber knows affluent
investors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such as
private equity and hedge funds.  Our group has also found that high net
worth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help you
structure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.  We then
provide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutional
money managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.  We also provide
the ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlations
to the appropriate indices.

I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from your
previous contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisor
was 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.  If your schedule permits, I
would like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in more
detail.  How does 4 PM sound?

- Mike

Michael:
Thanks for putting the paperwork together.

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present
opportunities such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other
ideas with strong growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd
listen.

John

Michael:
Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option
premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE
and will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I
was not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order
to hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look
into that for me.
John.

John -

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be
in a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not
sure that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're
interested.

> roughly 700-800 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the
> end of the traditional withdrawal season.
> 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this
> year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or
> production added per rig.
> 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other
> variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and
> industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning
> of winter will be near or below last year's 2,800 Bcf level.
> 4. Thus, it appears likely that the "heat" will remain on natural gas
> prices throughout 2001.
> 5. Consequently, we believe that many E&P shares will post solid gains
> again this year, spurred largely by mounting confidence in the
> sustainability of strong natural gas prices.

Michael:
Thanks for putting the paperwork together.  

I would have interest in meeting if you can present unique investment 
opportunities that I don't have access to now.  Most of my contact with 
financial advisors in the past has consisted of them suggesting a mutual 
fund, telling me to invest in Home Depot, Sun, and Coke, or trying to pass 
off their banks' biased research reports as something valuable.  The above 
services provide no value to me personally.  If you can present opportunities 
such as access to private equity or hedge funds, or other ideas with strong 
growth potential and low correlation to the S@P, I'd listen.

John

Bill, were you able to talk with Sony's Treasurer today?  As you know, we 
have a Friday deadline that is fast approaching.  We have a call with the San 
Diego team tomorrow and I would like to have an update ready for them.  
Please page me at 888-766-4103 to give me an update.

Not sure if you were aware of 2 items that Jennifer passed on to me:  1.)  We 
as EES have recently signed a confidentiality agreement with Sony.  2.)  
Sony's web site has alot of financial numbers (I don't know if they are 
broken-out).

Also, we are preparing for alternative S-T solutions.  How many months are 
you willing to allow at this point (we are coming off a 4 month deal) and if 
we do a PX plus basis deal (reduced market exposure) does that change our 
position at all?Message-ID: <32451775.1075857611153.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

I think so in a month or so.  Problem now is that there is so much customer 
buying on any pullbacks and selling on rallies that the market, with such a 
flat curve, is going nowhere.  That will change, but it's going to take a 
while.  I like it eventually.

Andy:
Enjoyed meeting with you.  

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to 
EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable 
electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if 
possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater 
than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to 
buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move 
my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the 
trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade 
to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other 
systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on 
the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.

I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on 
Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or 
metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other 
traders.
John

Thank you so much for your time last week.

David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
issues helpful for our own market.
This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
our side of the pond.

Best regards

Michael:
Appreciate the idea.  However, with my natural long, I'm not looking to 
really trade around the position.  I believe ENE will continue to be range 
bound, but in case it is not, I don't want to forgo 50% of my option premium.
I have price targets of where I would like to lighten up exposure to ENE and 
will use calls to implement the stategy.  To that regards, I noticed I was 
not approved to sell naked calls.  I would like that ability in order to 
hedge some exposure I have of unexercised vested options.  Please look into 
that for me.
John.

John -

I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be an 
opportunity to buy back the calls you sold.  Of course, you would then be in 
a position to sell calls again if the stock makes a bounce.  I'm not sure 
that ENE @ 75 is the place, but maybe @ 73.  Call me if you're interested.

Looks good except for settlement period.  Industry standard and for ease to 
Enron, a spread trade is treated as two separate trades.  Therefore, there 
will be two settlement periods for the respective legs of the transaction.  
The file below states settlement period is 5 days after both legs have been 
set.  Please change to 2 settlement periods, 5 days after each respective leg 
has been set.

We've started breaking out separate P&L's.  It's been a very difficult 
process so far for a number of reasons.  The last processes will be 
separating out the P&L on the executive reports and on VAR. That will happen 
this week.  Meanwhile, the P&L will be retroactive to the start of the year 
and we are going through all the positions such that the total skew is zero 
or an adjustment will be made to get it there.   At the end of the year there 
will be a number next to Maggi's name that he will not dispute.  His 
contribution to the fixed side when I'm on vacations or in meetings will 
continue to be a subjective process.

Mike:

The presentation is a great idea!  Per our conversations tonight, let's keep 
the EBS slides to 4-5 pages maximum; I have spoken to Chris Charbonneau and 
he will have an even briefer discussion on EIN's pulp & paper initiative.   
The purpose of the call is to introduce you to Kinko's decision makers who 
can understand a brief overview of your questions then provide the phone 
numbers of the appropriate Kinko's contact who could work with you on your 
value proposition definition.  Subsequent to the call, you would then follow 
up with meetings as you deemed appropriate.  This is not a call for 
details!   

Since you'll need additional time and we don't want to waste the time of the 
other Enron participants (Chris Charbonneau and Ed Quinn), they will present 
first then leave you with the balance of the time.  You noted that you'd be 
forwarding your overview to me later this evening.  Thanks.  I'll  look 
forward to receiving it.  Tomorrow, I'll add EIN's(Enron Industrial Markets) 
piece then cc:mail you on what I send to James Thompson.

Thanks again for the excellent suggestion.

Dorothy and I have assembled a short PPT that is currently in Matt's hands 
for review. Once finalized we will forward it to Chris Chabonneau who will 
add Pulp and Paper slides. Total length to be around 12 - 15 slides. I spoke 
to James Thompson who recommended this approach. We will have the

it's one of those theoretically great trades, but those don't always work.  
Still, I'll put it on and win 7 times out of 10.  just so hard for the market 
to rally the backwardation is so weak. can easily see h going under if no 
weather appears.

the end of the season is typically the best month to hold. Even if the first 
part of the summer is weak, people will be hesistant to sell the back half.  
Same with the winter.  That's why I'm long H2.  It has good correlation with 
the front on up moves and tends to hold value on the down move.

Thanks, Chaz, for the response.  What I am looking for in question #3 
(purchase commitment) is did I convey the info correctly re:  what BMC will 
accept from Enron to allow the EBS deal to close?  From notes to the Net 
Works directors and Bob McAuliffe, I have copied the following statements 
into the space below:  

"1)  The pricing is applicable if EBS gets their deal done, and you are 
willing to provide some form of commitment (at least in writing, either 
e-mail or letterhead) to purchasing a BMC product in 2001...  For example, if 
Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their current 
testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail (or 
other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 (the 
preference would be to get the "buy" done by end of 1st Qtr, if possible).  
This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with their 
purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC."  Is this correct the 
way I have presented it to NetWorks?  Will their replies work for you if 
completed as requested above?
 
I didn't want to put you in a bind when I told the NetWorks teams what BMC 
would feel is acceptable proof-of-commitment, nor did I want to have to go 
back to the Net Works group and change the requirements.

I've got another note to send you in a minute or so, from Doug Cummins.

Thank you,
Jeff

Jeff,

Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal.  We are making real progress.  
Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  
$4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services
2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  
No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 
3.  Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving 
purchase commitment from Enron?  
Not sure what you mean here
4.  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be 
done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?
We prefer the 14th, but if we can't get it until the 15th, that will work


Please let me know if you have any other questions.  I will call you tomorrow 
to touch base.

Steve/Chaz - 

I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts 
folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of 
your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten 
(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some 
Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed 
materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the 
contract at this point.  

I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one 
form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been 
requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  
Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness 
of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc.  In addition, 
I have re-iterated the time urgency.

I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  
Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am 
meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have 
me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call 
me back.

Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for 
them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you 
still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the 
"accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Your 
note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 
6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?

I will call you to follow up on this note.

Thank you,

imagine you have a gas well in the middle of west texas and you only have one 
pipeline running to your well.  the guy who owns the pipeline can fuck you 
because you have no choice but to flow your gas that way.  split connect 
means you have at least 2 options to flow your gas so the price the producer 
receives is more competitive and if anything happens to one pipeline you 
don't have  to shut your gas in because you move it to another pipe.  

i'm going out with my brother and sime guys from work tonight.   are you free 
saturday day and night?

'Split connect' isn't in my petroleum industry dictionary.  I'm counting
on you for a definition.

Do you have plans tonight?

i think we would rally if march were the only thing traded.  Problem is 
summer and on out so weak.  trade scale up seller of jv as it gets close to 
600.  some customer selling in cal 2.  so h/j and j/k need to blow out 
because no other spread is moving.  i'm a seller of j/k so h/j needs to 
blow.  all other trade is scale up seller of that so it can move but slowly.  
it's a struggle each penny at this point.  at least one spread needs to break 
if we're going to run and i don't see that happening.

This morning's 6-10 day forecast models are showing somewhat better
agreement.  All three models move the main cold trough axis to the Great
Lakes area by the last half of the period.  This shift allows for cold
Polar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states by
days 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).  The Canadian and
European continue more troughing in the southern branch in the
Southwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continued
ridging in the Southern states--from Texas to the Southeast--keeping
them warmer and away from the cold.  The American eliminates this
southern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadian
breaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see cold
weather at the beginning of the 11-15 day period.  The European appears
to hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South. In all cases,
the West Coast should see some gradual warming by late in the period.
All three models also continue a very amplified flow pattern in Canada
with a plentiful supply of strong, cold air.

More details, including early information from the ensembles, will be
available with the 6:30am ET release.

-Matt Rogers

Jeff,

Honestly and for your (Enron) eyes only - attached is the modified 
spreadsheet of what my group is seriously looking at purchasing.  Basically, 
we like their Change Management tools but not really interested in Patrol 
(monitoring).

We will have a more definitive answer by Thursday.  We DBA's (eCommerce, 
Corp, and London) are trying to make a joint decision, but the other two 
groups are dragging out their evaluations...

i think you're absolutely right about q/u.  again just a question of when to 
put it on.  Seems as if I'm always on the offer of that spread.  yesterday i 
had a 4.5 offer all day and i think i got 50 or so.  i can almost leg it 
better by buying winter and selling summer and the j/q spread. i would like 
to see it widen another penny before stepping in and i think with the 
weakness in the winter and relative weakness of cal 2, on any rally that 
could happen.

was that you on the q/u/v fly yesterday?Message-ID: <14789735.1075857612160.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

put it to you this way completely between you and me. i have every expectation
of making myself about a a myn this year(dont want to jinx myself). ive herd
suggestions that this new deal cud be better cuz of the guarantees + bonus. i
dont know yet, hasnt been offered or even discussed directly. but if it does 
and
its very good they gonna need a ngas guy in houston. i think we could put

don't care about the front.  i think its vulnerable to a good short squeeze 
like we saw on thruday and friday.  trade is getting short in here with cash 
such a piece.  if weather ever changes, which the weather boys are saying it 
might in 2 weeks, the cash players are going to be big buyers.  don't really 
want to carry length on the way down waiting for that to happen though.   
Backs are crazy stong.  cal 3 traded as high as +10.  everybody a buyer as 
california trying to buy any fixed price energy they can find

so many technicians bullshit  their way "support at 5400-5600 but if it
breaks that look for 5250".  if every technician put specific trades on a
sheet with entry and exit points and published them every day, a lot of
people would be unemployed.

Subject:  Re: v/x





i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late
morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point
on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily
trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes
equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k
cash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet
that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get
there k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will
be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last
year.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are
selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling
their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z
spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in there
right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primary
juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm a
seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it either way though.

you got me wrong-i wanna sell oct buy nov forward. look-two scenarios med
longer
term. we inject like mad early summer-economy stays crappy the frot of the
curve
gets slaughtered.-oct/nov goes to 3 cts sometime between now and end sep
   scenario 2-they dont enject what they want-oct /nov wil stay tite
between say
3-and 10 cts like this year but man after this winter they will panic at
some
point and buy the hell out of the winter strip and blow out oct /nov to 30
cts
cuz they panic. to me if that one was to ever backwardate it was this
summer-low
low stx and injections and they still blew out cuz they panicked about
winter-as
we see this winter now for good reason..?? capeche? i thinkit a win win

 you still in the damn mar/apr-i only sold a little prenumber-cant beleive
how
this got killed after-what changed?? from 1:30 to 2:05

Jim, can you assist me with this customer.  Based on the attached email, we
have not put this customer in touch with the proper person in purchasing.
This is a good account; I need your help to make sure we provide them the
proper contact.

Please have the proper person call Carmen and also let me know they followed
up.

Thx, Buck

i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late 
morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point on 
v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on 
value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between 
hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 
cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet that's what it is 
worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3.  The 
same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will be exceptionally 
strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year.  But cal 2 will 
lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are selling right now because 
every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 
will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j 
blow out.  After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h 
again.  my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will 
be under some pressure.  i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it 
either way though.

you got me wrong-i wanna sell oct buy nov forward. look-two scenarios med 
longer
term. we inject like mad early summer-economy stays crappy the frot of the 
curve
gets slaughtered.-oct/nov goes to 3 cts sometime between now and end sep
   scenario 2-they dont enject what they want-oct /nov wil stay tite between 
say
3-and 10 cts like this year but man after this winter they will panic at some
point and buy the hell out of the winter strip and blow out oct /nov to 30 cts
cuz they panic. to me if that one was to ever backwardate it was this 
summer-low
low stx and injections and they still blew out cuz they panicked about 
winter-as
we see this winter now for good reason..?? capeche? i thinkit a win win

 you still in the damn mar/apr-i only sold a little prenumber-cant beleive how
this got killed after-what changed?? from 1:30 to 2:05

agree guys are short h/j.  hard to see a big move with cash/futures trading 
flat.  agree that it has some squeeze potential though.  Started moving today 
as, simultaneously, march started running up and j aron won a big customer 
deal.  customer, maybe a hedge fund, bot 1000+ jv 450 puts.  weather 
frustrating me too.  a little long but it's in the backs so I haven't been 
hurt.  Sure would be nice to get some more weather and have this thing start 
going crazy again.  Seen liquids processing come back on at these levels.   
Would guess more than 50% has from peak.  Industrial demand different story.  
industrial economy just so weak that many petchems and others are burning 
less because of their markets, not fuel costs.  Chrystler is a prime 
example.   Any switching back to gas from industrial or switching back to 
domestic production from overseas muted by weak economy.

John,

Could you do me a big favor.  Sherry has been really working hard and doing a 
good job.  Do you think that you could talk with one of your contacts and get 
her a pair of Rockets tickets.  I know they are a playing the Clippers 
tommorrow night.   I know that no one else wants to see the Clippers, but 
she's never been to a game and would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Contact Andy Rowe at 713 966 2107.   
They are a medium term fundamental energy player.  They have never indicated 
any interest in anything besides nymex or hub gas daily, but that may 
change.  They have interest in trading on EOL but have not gotten approval

John- can you give me the name of your business line contact there, job 
function and phone number?  Also, whatever you know about their trading 
style- are they macro, program, technical?  Would they be interested in the 
same service we give Tudor, i.e do they want a salesperson to bring them 
ideas from our various trading groups??  Do they want to trade on-line or are 
they already??

Based on what you come back with, I'll give a call over there and see how I 
can resurrect the ISDA negotiations and get them trading...

Talk to you Monday,
CA

John,

The guy from Nymex can not come until next week, Thursday  2/8/01 at 4:00.   
It will last at a minimum of three hours and a maximum of 4 hours (which is 
unlikely).
 There is nothing on your calendar for that day.  Will this day and time work 
for you?  Let me know and then I will send an email out to the desk to make 
arrangements to attend the meeting that day.

-Ina

Douglas,

A HUGE THANK YOU from me to you!  This is exactly what I was hoping for (even 
if the amount of purchase is not what some folks might have been wishing for, 
the reply is critically important)!  I really appreciate your having taken 
the time to help out by providing this information.  

I will check back with you on Thursday, if I haven't heard from you by then, 
to see about the "commitment letter"!

Thank you again,

Jeff
p.s.  I will be forwarding your note to Randy Matson and Bob Martinez, to see 
if it would help them in their efforts.  I'll also copy you on that one.

Jeff,

Honestly and for your (Enron) eyes only - attached is the modified 
spreadsheet of what my group is seriously looking at purchasing.  Basically, 
we like their Change Management tools but not really interested in Patrol 
(monitoring).

We will have a more definitive answer by Thursday.  We DBA's (eCommerce, 
Corp, and London) are trying to make a joint decision, but the other two 
groups are dragging out their evaluations...



Regards,
Douglas

Hey:
Sorry I've taken a few days to respond.  Just the more I think about it, the 
worse of an idea it seems for both of us.  There is nothing good that can 
come of it either professionally or personally.  I still regard you as a good 
friend.  Nothing has changed that nor do I think we need to act weird around 
each other going forward.  Something I think we both wanted to try and we 
did.  Maybe best left there though.

John - do you mind sharing your Fimat line with the crude traders?  Current 
usage is about $6 million.  Also Warren thought that he might be able to 
change the variation limit from about $10 million to $6 million.  This change 
would allow us to use the line for $14 million for original margin (they have 
a good rate.)  Warren is going to call you about it.  Sarah

Tom:
My assistant spoke to Judy Smith about myself and my partner grabbing an 
extra seat on the jet to Tampa. 

My partner and I were invited to the game by a couple of gentlemen from New 
York that I do business with.  Unfortunately, since I run the nat gas 
derivatives desk and February expiration is next Monday, the only way we 
could go is if the jet were coming back Sunday night.  No commercial flights 
would get us back in time.  

Judy indicated it was fine if we caught a ride on the way back, so my 
contacts in NY booked the trip, including buying game tickets.  I am now 
hearing that you may be leaving early Sunday night.  I was just wondering if 
your plans had firmed up.  Obviously, it would be tremendously helpful to me 
if the plane were leaving after the game.  

Please advise,

Dear  John,

First of all, congratulations. You have made headlines in Brazil.
Whenever you come to our country, let me know, so I can provide you with
assitance.

When convenient, please let me know Jeff Shenkman's(Enron Global Markets)
email, so I can get in contact.

All the best,

____________________________________________________

Dear Jeff,
After reading a series of reports on Enron Global Markets,  I decided to get
in contact.
I live in Brazil and had a chance to meet Jim Ballantine whom was(until
recently) heading Enron's operations in Brazil.
Currently, I work as an Strategic Planning Manager at Copergas, a Natural
Gas Distributor located in Northeast Brazil (partly owned by Enron).
Jim once mentioned that EOL intends to come to Brazil. According to the
press, Enron Global Markets will be responsable for expanding the EOL
platform worldwide.
I want you to know that my professional background includes IT, Government,
Marketing and Business Development. When Enron Global Markets decides to
expand into Brazil, let me know.  I will be more than happy to join such an
outstanding team.
My best  and a SUPER 2001,
Cacio Carvalho

We signed a contract with Requisite Technology (http://www.requisite.com) 
Monday night to provide electronic cataloging tools for our SAP system 
(they're replacing the i2Technologies products currently in place.

Requisite hosts catalogs for many major companies and digital marketplaces.  
They have offices in Westminster, CO and Toronto.  John and I discussed the 
opportunities Tuesday, and there may be one with EBS.  EES is probably less 
likely, but it may be worth the investigation.

I know the VP of Sales, North America, so let me know if you're interested in 
pursuing, and when.

Thanks.

I was wondering if you could use your broker contacts for some really great

tickets.  

I'll take care of you down the road w/Rockets, Astros and Texan ticket!

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

I would like to invite you to a meeting with Jeff Shankman on Tuesday
January 16, 3:30 p.m.  at Jeff Shankman's office.

We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20 
Wharton School
students visiting Enron.  A Wharton  tiger team works through a semester on a 
special project, proposed by
a corporation. The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the 
impact of
electronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will  
result in a report that
will be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation. I hope that  you will 
find this report useful.

 We have invited our tiger team to visit Enron. The students will arrive on 
Thursday, 
January 18, and will spend Friday at Enron. I would appreciate if you could 
find 30 minutes
on Friday to talk to the students.

The meeting with Jeff on Tuesday  should not last longer than 10-15 minutes.

Vince

a couple of observations from here:
cash/futures getting whacked.  whereas last weekend cash traded $1 over G, 
this weekend will probably trade $.15 over.  the lack of weather giving the 
market time to regroup.  good thing because another week of cold and the 
system was going to break.   certainly still has that chance in feb.  saw 
utilities recently staying on a verystrict withdrawal schedule and meeting 
any extra demand through spot market.  in effect, they said we're not 
withdrawing anymore so we'll buy marketers storage.  they had to encourage 
marketers to sell it to them, so cash was extremely strong in periods of even 
normal demand and should continue to be if/when any weather comes again.  
this week demand so low that utilities can meet demand without buying much in 
mkt.  g/h getting whacked in sympathy.  
probably priced 25 term deals through broker market  and own originators in 
past two days.  24 were from the buy side.  it's as if pira came in and told 
everyone term was cheap.  however, they've got the opposite view.  customers 
just seeing gas at $4 anytime as being okay now.  don't see any let up in 
back support for a while.  
front spreads the hardest call right now.  g/h h/j j/k ??? can't decide what 
to do with them and from the volatility in them, appears neither can anybody 
else.  almost think best play is taking feb gas daily against march, hoping 
for a cold spell that breaks the system and get a couple $20+ prints in 
cash.  probably as likely to happen in g as h and g/h has much less 
downside.  

doing well here.  actually having the best month ever 11 days in.  played 
front short against term length.  got out of front shorts today.   probably 
early but gas has a history of getting off the canvas when least expected.  
will keep term length meanwhile.   i've hated summer backwardation forever.  
agree about u/h.  a little less crazy about  the trade now because i think 
the easy money was made over the past two days.  unbelievable spec demand for 
next winter over past week kept summer winter spread constant on rally up and 
crushed on move down.  jv/xh went from 22 to 3.5 in 5 days while front 
virtually unchanged.

don't know what to think of this summer longer term.  certainly not as easy 
as it was last summer when it was obvious $3 was not equilibrium for gas.  
now $6 for this summer, i don't know.  we're gonna have to inject the hell 
out of gas and keep some demand priced out for a long time.  but we will feel 
production increase hit the market.  just buy vol.

Significant progress was recently made between Enron's and Salomon Smith
Barney's counsels.  We have offered Enron a $50 million facility that can be
used for both original and variation margin.  With these elevated NYMEX
margins, I am sure it will help your P/L.

Our counsel, Bob Klein is meeting with Citibank's attorneys to discuss some
of the small issues where we both share some exposure.

Citibank is one of your lead commercial banks while SSB is one of your lead
investment banks.  The relationship is so sound, we will work out the
wrinkles.  I'll be in touch.

P.S. Someone told me you went to Vanderbilt..any chance 1988-1992ish?

Folks:

John and Sireesha have just pushed to staging a bunch of enhancements / bug 
fixes / new features.  Included in them are:

 1.  Configurable Questionnaire
 2.  Invitee Lists Part I (this does NOT include the upload of the contact 
lists)
 3.  User Statistics
 4.  Fix for the Issuing Entity
 5.  Auction security fix
 6.  Auction enhancements Part I 
 7.  Rewrite of the view deal page impacting permission levels in EVERY domain
 8.  The Adapter for the User Registration piece (this should be seamless to 
the user, but be happy that     this change ELIMINATES message brokers from 
this process)
 9.  Various bug fixes including those relating to view closing etc.

The remaining auction enhancements are planned to be pushed sometime early 
next week.

I would recommend everybody spend some time testing next week and reflect 
their comments / suggestions to John and I.  

The location of the test site is:  http://testfinweb1.ecomtest.enron.com.  
You also need to establish new IDs and passwords (since your production IDs 
and Passwords will not work!).  The admin ID and password (if you need to 
approve users and deals to test them are - ID: jspitz; Pwd: pass).

We do PLAN on pushing all this stuff to PRODUCTION (barring any major bugs or 
mishaps) next FRIDAY - Dec 8th, 2000.

Look forward to your comments.  Thanks.  SR:-)Message-ID: <24417573.1075848343225.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Nick

Hope things are going well.

In the next few days we need to do two things.

1. Set the termination value of the existing options
2. Set the terms for new options for the next year.

Since the option is cash settled and not settled with actual currency
payments, while we need actual currency exchanges to mitigate our risk, we
would like to talk to you to manage that.

We also need to spend a few minutes, on the structure of the next set of
options, to ensure a good execution.

When you get  a chance give William Stuart ( 713-853-1507) our ccy trader
or myself (713-853-6750) a call, or point us in the right direction.

Thanks


Harry

I will be attending the ski outing - I am not sure about my arrival and 
departure dates, but I did put tentative dates. Once I make my bookings I 
will update you on my final dates. I might stay an extra day, and will pick 
that up. Thanks

Heather,

Per our conversation, I am going to go ahead and process this order without 
the keyboards and/or mice.  The desktops, monitors and Palm Pilots come to 
roughly $34,000, which means I will need approval from a Sr. Director before 
I can place the order.  Can you have the appropriate person send me an email 
with his/her approval?  I will place the order as soon as I have that.  
Thanks!

I quickly plotted the short and the long curves and the following come out in 
your face.

1. Is this policy easing going to be a one shot ( a la 98 ) followed by a 
quick pick up in economic activity, or is this going to be a more deeper 
situation. That is the big one.  The curves vote for a small road-bump which 
will be rectified by a couple of eases over the next 6 months. Something the 
Fed can handle easily and quickly. This is most likely NOT going to happen - 
this is not a 98 and things are going to play out differently.  There are a 
number of other possibilities.

2. The current slow-down is two pronged - capital spending slowdown from 
businesses ( especially on IT with the internet bust ) and the consumer 
spending slow-down , possibly because of the stock market wealth effect. Both 
of these have already hit the durable goods section.  This reversal is 'Real' 
which takes longer to turn then the 'Financial crisis' hence there is good 
possibility we see a protraction of this weakness and even coupled with the 
fed eases this is going to take longer than six months to get better.

3. The new administration is going to take this as a good opportunity to 
force tax cuts. How does the Fed look at those ? Will the Fed balk and be 
less aggressive in the rate cuts expecting the tax cuts , will it ignore 
them. That makes the equation harder. It also to some extent argues that 
longer term rates go up if these tax cuts materialize. But on the shorter 
term who that effects Fed policy will have profound effect on the curve.


All these favor a steeper curve. The 2-5 at -23 ( -6 on swap curve ), 2 -10 
at -15 ( 18 on the swaps ) and 2-30 at 19 bps ( 37 bp) should all be steeper 
as market realizes the length of this ease cycle.  If this cycle lasts an 
year ( the final and the last ease happens next Dec ) then the 2-10 should be 
40 bp positive, as the market realizes that.

Harry,

Today's live auction for Northern Border Pipeline's procurement of line pipe 
was quite a success!  Here are some highlights:



The auction lasted longer than the scheduled 15 minutes due to the automatic 
extension feature resulting from new Best Bids placed during the last two 
minutes of the auction.  Please note that we earned $52,500 for this auction 
and are on track to do another auction for NBPL on 1/30 for a $20,000 fee.

Regards, 
Ross

Subject: EOL Model with commodity markets

I am sending you the EOL model on Greg Piper's request. The model reflects 
accurately the traded volumes on EOL for 2000. Projections for 2001- 2011 
were built based on feedback from traders, investment bank and research 
institutes B2B forecasts and, common sense. These can be manipulated by 
changing the assumptions in the assumption sheet.

On the financial side the balance sheet and income statement have not been 
completely modelled since no specific deal structure has been defined. 
Though, they include the main revenue and expense components for EOL.

If you have any doubts with respect to the functionality of the model, please 
let me know. I am available to clarify them at your convenience.

here is another request for a direct EOL data feed.  We should figure out how 
we want to respond to such inquiries.  I have never heard of this company 
before.

Good Day to you.
I would like to introduce myself and my company.
Kalahari Ltd is a UK based software company that has for the past 14
years been supply pricing software to the Financial Markets.
Over the past year we have been branching out into the energy markets
and are currently working for a number of UK based Electricity
companies.
One such company (London Electricity) has asked us to produce software
to filter and highlight online trading prices. This allows them to see
ONLY the best price in the market for any one product at a time. This is
due to the sudden explosion of internet based price delivery systems. To
enable us to acieve their requirements we require an API to the relative
online trading systems. Today I spoke to a gentlemen in your call centre
who gave me your contact details. Could you please advise me if you do
indeed publish an API to your internet trading platform and if so how do
I go about getting it.
We would of course be prepared to sign a non disclosure agreement in
this respect.

I look forward to hearing from you in due course.

With kind regards

Dear Harry,

It was really nice talking to you this week. I hope I could provide you with
information sufficient for making the right decision. From my side, I once
again want to highlight the fact that if I am given a chance, I will do all
I can to prove that the people who gave me this chance made the right
decision.

With best regards,

Dear Mr. Arora:
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for taking the time and
effort to come to Owen and interview me for the Summer Associate Program at
Enron. I am excited about the prospect of developing newer markets and
e-markets for trading various financial instruments and wish to be a part of
the Enron team in the development of these new markets. I firmly believe
that my past experience in the commodities trading area and my finance and
e-commerce concentration at Owen would enable me to make a significant
contribution in developing newer markets and e-markets for various
commodities & products and would greatly appreciate an opportunity to be a
part of the Enron team. Many Thanks once again for interviewing me for the
summer associate program at Enron.

Sincerely,
Muthu (Max)

Harry,

I enjoyed our interview today and hope to continue discussions with Enron
about a summer internship.

I couldn't resist sending you this link.  I don't know if you recall, but
during our talk we conducted an exercise attempting to determine new uses
for tissue.  I was surprised to learn that Kimberly-Clark has just announced
a new product.  They actually were holding a analyst conference call this
morning to discuss earnings and their new venture.  Your questions are
certainly very current!  I wish I had been creative enough to think of this
product during our interview.

Here is the link.

Hi Jean-Maurice,

I just wanted to touch base with you to see how your DealBench experience
is going.  I realize you may have some colleagues that are working with you
that may not have been in our demo in November.  I'm happy to spend some
time with them on the phone walking through the functionality within the
site.  Please feel free to call me at 713-345-3726.

I look forward to hearing from you to know how things are going.

Kind Regards,
Kristi DeMaiolo

Subject: Re: quick question


Just got off the phone with Kira.  She asked me what y'all do and I probably
butchered it, but she sounded interested (especially when I closed by saying 
it
would be a business services, fee-based revenue stream - from what I know in
the industry, Yahoo's all about that these days, trying to find complements to
its existing largely ad-driven model for which they are getting pummeled).  
She
said you should forward any information on to her at kira@yahoo-inc.com.  To
reach her by phone (I'd recommend handling initial contact through email and
then suggesting phone time, but your call), I don't have her direct number, 
but
called the main Yahoo corporate number 408-731-3300, then used the dial by 
name
directory - her last name is spelled Zahn, but you have to keep adding letters
from her first name (i went through K-I) before it will recognize it.  She and
her husband both were in law school with me and are very, very cool folks.  He
works at Silicon Valley Bank now.

Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.

      Enron Metals Weekly Review

Good evening ...one and all . It hardly seems possible that  we are another 
week on  already such has been the pace of activity here . The  ebb and flow 
in the Ali  market both in the spreads and outright price have kept  our 
valiant dealers on their toes  as  seemingly the whole market  vies to  avail 
itself of our  pricing and liquidity services on-line ! .   Daily volumes 
have  continued to grow with  over 800  separate transactions being seen 
today! .  In fact volumes have risen by approximately  56% since December  
from a daily average  of 357 to a daily average of 557  for January .At the 
same time the regular Non-EOL transaction count has decreased from about 1800 
trades a day to 1586 trades  since December.    Your efforts at getting  the  
registered customers who had not  completed an on line trade are beginning 
to  pay dividends  finally - but the migration remains painfully slow . Keep 
plugging away 
   
                




                            

 The graph  above illustrates the growth of our  average daily online 
transaction volumes  in relation to our regular transaction volume on a 
monthly basis  from July of 99 to date .


This week's daily  transaction volume  is another  record and   but for the 
blip on Monday  which put down to the  Mother's day in Africa  holiday  would 
have been sensational .  
 
  

   


We have asked for your response to several queries over the past three weeks 
and have received little or no  reaction.  Consequently we shall ask again.  

Currently at the top of the list:  if  each of you could create a list of 
Metals Conferences you believe would be beneficial for Enron metals to 
attend, speak at and/ or have metals or EnronOnline presence, it would be 
greatly appreciated. This is a multi faceted sales and marketing tool for 
your benefit  .  Aside from the overall goal of creating a unified metals 
marketing plan, we are also trying to prepare a budget to assure that proper 
attention and funds are given Enron metals Global exposure in 2001 .  
Therefore, if we do not receive your recommendations  well in  advance we 
will not be in a position to sponsor them . We have created a conference 
listing which will be circulated next week . Please add to it  if we have 
missed any off . and mark onto our list those you think should have  our 
attention . 


For those of you that missed it last week, we have attached another copy of 
the Account Application Form.  The completion of this form for BOTH 
traditional and online customers will speed your client's access to trading 
with Enron Metals.



The lack of contributions for this review  from  any of you is  rather 
disappointing . We will continue to offer you  items that you may find of use 
. However the purpose of this  review is also  to incorporate content  from  
around the network of our  global field offices.    I know you are all very 
busy  making money for the cause . This  medium is  a useful platform to get 
your message over .   

For those of you not on the circulation lists  see the attached reports    

       The Metals Crammer report    


       The daily Options report 




 Whilst not exactly a feature  we thought it might be  a useful exercise in  
client relationship damage  limitation  to explain   what happens when a 
customer finds he cannot trade  on line .This has begun to occur more 
regularly as our volumes and activity increase.

 Customers are allocated  a credit line for EOL within the system based upon 
their  agreements.  This limit   is set daily   as a  default against the 
clients name . basis the AS400 's  net valuation of the client's position  . 
The amount of available  variation  credit  on the client's account  on EOL 
is  set as his  limit f or the next days trading . If the client should 
trigger this limit  during the next day's trading  the system will reject the 
trade and lock out the customer . Not very user friendly   as the customer is 
not told why .  London credit (Hamish's team) get a red flag , as of course 
do the traders running the stack managers as they see the trade rejected.  
The problem now becomes one of frustration for the customer as the system 
will not allow him to liquidate his position either in part or whole .He will 
have to pick the phone to do this . Secondly the resetting of any limit in 
the system takes 48hrs .  This  is being  worked on but  we must remember 
that Metals are the only futures products on the system and the other OTC 
products on the system  are dealt with differently .  It also serves to 
highlight that  clients with small credit lines in the 1 to 200,000 dollar 
range are not really suited to use EOL . Security  such as g/tees and cash 
are taken into account but can be missed  ,but forward profits are as it is 
net availability that is  used on the AS400.   This will all improve with the 
introduction of  a new bridge  between the Enron  risk system and the AS400  
in the very near future .  
 
 In the meantime  it will be up to you to  keep the peace and explain to your 
clients .  Get them to keep within their limits . Call them quickly when they 
get locked out.   




Remember, we are here to help your efforts and help create positive 
communication lines between our offices world-wide.  So, send us your 
thoughts, questions, concerns, local area market news  etc.  We will look 
forward to hearing from you.

Here is McKinsey's work.  Broad overview only, with no specific analysis of 
grains, meats or softs.  Priorities here are grains, then meats, and 
separately 
softs given our existing exposure to this segment (53k Tons of Cocoa Physical,
Softs Brokerage Business in London).

Mark, I would encourage you to come down to 29 (assuming you are on 33) and
we will be more than happy to share all of our resources to get you up to 
speed
on our analysis and why we think these segments hold a lot of opportunity.

Looks like EES has pretty much decided to use us for this RFQ (see the Word 
doc attached below) -- remember that we have a meeting scheduled with EES on 
Monday to discuss a "realtionship" and pricing.  Let's make sure before our 
meeting that we are all in agreement as to the pricing approach we will take 
with them.

Dear Mr. Arora:

I wanted to thank you for taking the time to interview me this past
Wednesday.  I enjoyed meeting you and other representatives of the company
and left our interview with a much greater understanding of what drives
Enron and what the company seeks in its applicants.  Your responses to my
questions only confirmed my already high opinion of the company.

As you know, I am a first year student at Owen concentrating in Finance and
Electronic Commerce.  I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Bentley College in
May of 1997 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics & Finance, and I
received an Honors Certificate in Economics from the University of Cambridge
in August of 1995.

After graduating from Bentley, I worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as
an analyst in its Financial Development Program.  Most recently, I worked as
an investments analyst for Thomson Financial, where I evaluated three major
business development initiatives and five acquisition proposals totaling $44
million and worked with senior management on a takeover bid for one of
Thomson's key competitors.  I also performed strategic, market, and
competitor analysis, and proposed ways of improving the organization's
overall competitiveness.  My professional experiences working in the High
Technology and Financial Information Services industries have led to a
complete redefinition of my career goals.  I much prefer to be on the front
lines of business, helping some of the world's most established
organizations make decisions that will impact their financial future and
competitive position in the market.   I am anxious to begin my career with
Enron and believe that a relationship with company would prove mutually
beneficial.

In closing, I would like to thank you again for interviewing me in
Nashville.  If you have any questions, please contact via e-mail at
Ajay.Jagsi@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu or at (615) 673-0329.


Have a wonderful week!

Here is my summary of our second round summer interviews.  Top 3 candidates 
below.

1. Craig -  Well rounded, Military background, excellent leadership 
experience (aircraft carrier pilot), did not have a finance background, but 
performed very well on Harry's analytical interview.  Very personable, 
confident and sold himself well.  I think he is very interested in Enron and 
would likely accept.

2. Victor - He was a strong candidate in my more subjective interview, but I 
didn't think he was quite as strong as Ajay.  However he outperformed Ajay in 
the analytical interview.  With that feedback from Harry I feel comfortable 
placing Victor ahead of Ajay.  Also very interested in Enron.

3. Ajay -  Very polished, presented/sold himself very well, Excellent 
understanding of Enron's business (did his homework),  Relative to others 
based on my interview he ranked in the top 2, However did not perform as well 
as others in the top 4-5 in the analytical interview.  For this reason I'd 
push him back to number three.

Aside from these three there were two others that are worth discussing.  

Casey Jones
Andrew Rosenberg

We Understand these two may have outstanding offers from firms that they are 
very interested in.  I would not consider either of these two ahead of Craig, 
but might place Casey ahead of Victor.  However I think Casey is least likely 
to accept the offer.  My suggestion would be to make offers to Craig & 
Victor, then consider a 3rd offer to Andrew, recognizing we would likely get 
a maximum of 2/3.

Dear Mr. Arora:
Hope this mail finds you in the best of health and cheer. I am sorry to know
that I have not been selected for the Enron Summer Associate Program and
would greatly appreciate any feedback that you can offer me with regards to
interview that I had with Enron.
I am extremely interested in working at Enron and firmly believe that my
prior experience in the commodities trading arena and the skills that I gain
in my MBA program will enable me to add significant value to Enron. I plan
to apply for the full time program at Enron and would like to use the
feedback to prepare myself for the full time associate program at Enron.
Many Thanks once again for taking the time and effort to interview me at
Owen and also for considering me for the Enron Summer Associate Program.

Sincerely,
Max

Hi Harry,
?
Just thought of saying hi since it has been an long  time.? How's everything 
in Houston?? Things in banking are slowing  down.? I'm just hoping that this 
project I'm staffed on will go live.?  There is a 90% chance.? Most activity 
now in Asia is M&A related.?  You see cross-border deals happening, i.e. 
Europe into Asia and Asia into the  U.S.? High yield and convertibles appear 
to be rocketing.? I've  encountered a couple of personalities at Lehman but 
so far things are  okay.??? Just got the bonus and so I'm thinking where to 
park the  money.? Maybe I'll invest it in power technology?since California  
lacks electricity.? Who knows.? 
?
I heard from Jens that you moved to Enron Online.? Jens got a great  vacation 
in Cuba.? I wish I could have joined him.
Well, that's all for now.
?
Best regards,
?

Regarding the lotting strategy, we do intend to be very flexible. Our general 
recommendation is that the number of lots should be around 10 but if there 
are situations where it makes sense to have more than 10 lots, we would not 
have a problem with it.
From a pricing perspective, as long as bids*lots is less than 150, we would 
treat it in a similar way.

Hope that works for you. Look forward to your confirmation (and the RC#)


Harry

Harry-

Before we go ahead with this, let's revise the first bullet to reflect a more 
realistic variation of how our soliciations might play out over the first and 
second quarter of  2001. 

As I see it (refer to the attachment for more information), we might conduct, 
at best, five sealed-bids over the next three months. However, for each of 
the bids there may be more than 10 lots in each bid. Looking at the attached 
Notice of Solicitation as an example, we have 7 separate blocks for suppliers 
to bid having up-to 3 bid scenarios for each block for a total of 21 lots for 
this phase. The way I see it, future soliciations will follow a similar 
model. 

Having said this, an alternative to the current language would be to have 5-6 
sealed bid opportunities with a 20-25 lot limit for each bid. Does this work 
for you or does this complicate the process for your group? 

Please advise....

Sam

John


We very much enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing opportunities 
for EES and DealBench to work together.  As we discussed, this email will 
serve as the framework for our pilot arrangement.  As soon as we receive an 
email confirmation from you, your team will be able to add deals to the 
DealBench platform.

3-month access as a standard user (15 sealed-bid deals with up to 10 lots for 
each deal) .  Months utilitzed do not need to be consecutive, but if a deal 
is up on DealBench in any day during a calendar month, that month will be 
inlcuded as part of the three month period.

EES will pay DealBench a fee of $22,500, with $7,500 due immediately, $7,500 
due February 28th, and $7,500 due March 31st.  We would like to debit your RC 
directly to avoid billing overheads. 
 
EES will solely control and be responsible for all business transactions that 
it conducts on the DealBench platform.  As such, DealBench assumes no 
liability for any EES business transactions conducted on DealBench.

We believe you will realize significant value from DealBench and look forward 
to working with you.  As you know, I am going to be happy when we do a Live 
Auction for you and save you some significant money.  Please confirm, with 
your RC number that you are IN with this arrangement. We also would want to 
explore further the larger opportunity - I will try to allocate some-one to 
work on that one with you next week.


Regards,


Harry Arora

Subject: DealBench 2/2 auction failure cause and solution
Importance: High


Event Sequence
? Lot 1 of two Sabre auctions went through without issues
? Between Lots, there was a scheduled 15 minute interval.  About 10 minutes 
into this period, developers monitoring the system saw errors showing up on 
the View Deal page.  Within minutes, users reported the same problem 
reentering the Sabre deal.  The rest of the site was unaffected
? Within five minutes, the problem was isolated to the document management 
subsystem of DealBench.  Solution Attempts:
? Restart the process that returns documents
? Move the documents off the deal
Solution:
? Create a second deal, same structure as the first, but without the 
documents.
? The auction on the second Lot started approximately 40 minutes late.  Once 
started, it continued without further errors through several auction 
extensions, finally resulting in a $500K savings for Sabre.

Cause
? Document management process stopped returning documents and was instead 
returning null values.  This caused the View Deal page to appear "hung". The 
Document to be served was the "deal agent logo", a special document type that 
is displayed at the top of the page.

Contributing Factors
? The run.bat script, which launches the document management Java process, 
was not logging its status
? The SQL statement that retrieves the deal agent logo did not correctly 
handle the special case of a document file being moved.  Therefore, moving 
the deal agent logo to another deal did not solve the error.   
? run.bat had never failed previously, and the process had been running 
consistently for over 60 days.  Therefore it was not initially suspected as a 
problem source.

Fixes
? An immediate stop-work on further enhancements to DealBench until system 
stability has been addressed
? Isolate document management process in the test environment, and thoroughly 
test all possible failure scenarios.
? Start logging and tracking of run.bat script and document management process
? Make document management process fully redundant, so it will failover in 
the event of error
? Increase monitoring on new log files
? Initiate an in-depth architectural review with Kevin Montagne's team, to 
identify further areas to improve system robustnessMessage-ID: <27179011.1075848343084.JavaMail.evans@thyme>

Kira-
I got your name (and email address) from Chad Muir and was hoping to arrange 
a time to briefly (and informally) talk to you about Yahoo's B2B business 
strategy and whether you think there might be any opporunities to discuss 
some strategic relationship between Yahoo and Enron Net Works's DealBench 
subsidiary.

Without getting into too many details, DealBench is an ASP addressing the 
needs of large, secure, sophisticated transaction participants.   We are 
currently offering live online auctioning capabilities, online virtual 
datarooms and certain deal areas for the syndication of bank products and 
lease portfolios.  We have completed transactions with nominal value of over 
$4 Billion since launching the site 4 months ago.   My initial thought is 
that this could potentially fit in nicely with what I believe is Yahoo's need 
for recurring transaction-based revenues in certain B2B areas.

Hopefully we can find time to talk soon.
Take care,
Jeff

Hi!

Where r u and how have u been? Saw in morning papers the news about
resignation of Sanjay Bhatnagar. ANy chance of ur coming to India?

Here things r all right. I have been in Daman for about a year now as
collector. It is a small union territory about 190 kms from Bombay. It's a
good weekend spot. If u visit Bombay, do drop in Daman. U can also plan a
journey to Diu, Dwarka, Somnath and Gir tiger reserve.


Keep in touch.

Dear Mr. Arora:

Once again, thank you for the great opportunity to demonstrate and prove my
credentials, interest and desire to work for Enron this summer during the
second round of on-campus interview at the Owen Graduate School of
Management at Vanderbilt University on January 24th. Although I have not
been selected for the Summer Associate position at Enron, I would like to
assure you that I am still interested in a full-time position at Enron upon
my graduation.

Meanwhile, I would greatly appreciate if you provide me with any feedback on
my performance during the interview. I am especially interested in your
opinion regarding the areas I need to improve.

Again, thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Dmitri Villevald

New Power Company and Azurix are other affiliate companies of Enron. EDS is a 
totally different company, to which we have outsourced some stuff - so they 
have a number of employees on our premises ( on EDS contract).

I personally do not work out at the bodyshop. So would be unable to help you 
on how it might be in the morning.  I am sure you can call the BodyShop and 
they can help you out.  If you have questions, our HR co-ordinator (Lauren or 
Ben) should be able to provide further assistance.

Subject: The Body Shop quick question

Harry,

Just a quick question for you, please.

I read the guidelines and included them below regarding the Body Shop.  At 
the beginning of the page, it includes the category of employees to include 
some that I am not familiar with.  Of course, I do see the area for 
contractors, however, I was curious what these classifications are.  Can you 
please let me know what these are?
New Power Company/Azurix/EDS Employees

I just want to be sure on the correct fees prior to making a commitment to 
join with them.  Also, have you ever been to the Body Shop in the morning?  
Do you know if it is super crowded or not?  I can't imagine too many people 
arriving at 5:30am.

Thanks ahead for your input.  I appreciate it.

Subject: Enron Flat Panel Procurement

Just left you a voicemail, but thought I would follow up with an email 
summarizing my conversation earlier today with Philippe.
Apparently for the new building, Enron will be purchasing 2000+ flat panels 
(I assume mostly PC monitors with potentially some Plasma TVs).   Philippe 
would like to arrange 3 or 4 bidders to compete in a live, online DealBench 
auction.   He mentioned that you would be in charge of contacting Compaq, NEC 
and the other suppliers of these displays and would be the primary Enron 
person involved in this procurement (I'm estimating it at a $2 to $4 million 
contract).

I wanted to offer to have one of our Marketing professionals spend some time 
with you to walk through a sample auction to make sure you are comfortable 
with our platform and that we can meet all your live auctioning needs.   
Please give me a call at 3-5629 when you have a minute to discuss.  If you 
want to arrange a demo, please contact Vanessa Carranza (3-5030).

thanks,
Jeff

Miguel,

EGEP extends our best wishes to you on pursuing your new assignment and 
expresses sincere appreciation for all of your assistance with our DealBench 
projects. 

You probably follow the DealBench activity but if you haven't watched 
specific details, we have observed the following activity level to date:
 India Deal Rooms A-G  9573 Deal and Document hits (since 27 Dec when stats 
became available)
 India Deal Room  H    417 Deal and Document hits (since opening 1 Feb)
 China Deal Rooms A-B    500 Deal and Document hits (since opening 23 Feb)

We consider the DealBench datarooms a great success.  We appreciate the 
insights you shared with us when we were first designing the rooms, as well 
as, the support  you provided with regard to our questions and problems 
thereafter.  You were always knowledgeable, resourceful, responsive and 
courteous in all of our dealings.

Thanks again, Miguel.  We will miss you in the DealBench project group but 
will look forward to hearing about your new assignment.  

Sincerely,

Thank you for taking time last week to meet with me and for arranging the
other meetings as well.  I enjoyed our discussion and learning about the
various opportunities within Enron.  I have been impressed with every group

Hi all,

I just wanted to sum up our discussions from yesterday.

Enron Global Assets is considering using DealBench for hosting virtual 
datarooms for the divestiture of 32 international assets. The projected total 
number of documents will be in the region of 3500. DealBench has offered to 
host these datarooms at a cost of $25k per dataroom. This is on the basis 
that you are hosting all 32 datarooms, as we have worked some steep discounts 
into the pricing. The term of the dataroom hosting services under this offer 
is for the year 2001.

We have also offered to help with the transition of the data to the improved 
dataroom platform once that is in place sometime in Q2. 

You have mentioned that a few documents that you intend to upload are bigger 
than 8MB. We have discussed that we can lift the current file size ceiling to 
greater than 8MB. I just want to make you aware that for users of the 
platform with slower connections it will be extremely time consuming to 
download these files. Even under ideal circumstances it will take al least 5 
minutes for a 15MB file to download. For users with slower connections it 
will potentially seem like the download has failed, even though the download 
is still in progress. This could result in a lot of calls to you and our 
help-desk.

As I mentioned it might be of value to you to have professional assistance 
with the conversion of your paper documents to PDF. We are working together 
with a company in Houston that could help in the conversion process. From our 
experience file size and quality of scans are greatly improved by outsourcing 
this function. This is especially true if one is performing an OCR process on 
the TIFF files during conversion to PDF. 

In the light of the urgency of your projects it might be a good idea to start 
the dataroom preparation process as soon as possible. May I ask why you 
suggested to wait until March to get back in contact with us ?

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call at 713-345-4147. We are 
very excited in helping you to deliver a world class solution.

Thanks

Tobias Munk

All,

There has been some concern about the lack of clarity regarding what 
functionality is ready for user acceptance testing in the staging 
environment.  To attempt to solve this problem, we have come up with a simple 
process that will enhance communication and will allow everyone on the team 
to know what functionality is in staging waiting for user acceptance signoff 
prior to a release to production.  Please read the attached one page document 
that details the proposed process.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Zach
