\subsection{Evaliex}
\textit{Evaliex} is an \gls{IE} evaluation tool which integrates these measurement concepts, like state-of-the-art scoring metrics, measuring string and semantic similarities and by parameterization of metric scoring, and provides an efficient user interface that supports evaluation control and the visualization of \gls{IE} results. To guarantee domain independence, the tool additionally provides a Generic Mapper for XML Instances (GeMap) that maps domain-dependent XML files containing \gls{IE} results to generic ones. Compared to other tools, it provides more flexible testing and better visualization of extraction results for the comparison of different (versions of) information extraction systems \cite{Feilmayr:2012}.

\textit{Evaliex}  was part of a master thesis by \citeauthor{Linsmayr:2010} in 2010. A corresponding paper was published by \citeauthor{Feilmayr:2012} later in 2012:
