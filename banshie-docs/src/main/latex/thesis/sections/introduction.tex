This work relates to the field of \gls{IE}...

\subsection{Background and motivation}
Missing standard, no comprehensive summary of state-of-the-art IE evaluation measures and metrics. Lack of well-designed, extensible evaluation framework for java-based IE tools.

\subsection{Objective}
A formal discussion of known and used performance measures for IE and a working prototype of a modular benchmark framework to run and test information extraction systems in isolation to measure IE-related performance measures, e.g. precision, recall and F-measure, as well as runtime performance measures, e.g. cpu time and memory consumption.

\subsection{Structure}
Background knowledge required to put this thesis into context: chapters \nameref{sec:information-extraction}, \nameref{sec:evaluation-methodology} and \nameref{sec:modularity}. Chapter \ref{sec:related-work} contains a discussion and comparison to related or similar work. Followed by chapters \ref{sec:design} and \ref{sec:analysis}: \nameref{sec:design} and \nameref{sec:analysis}. The conclusion in chapter \ref{sec:conclusion} will be a critical review of the work done in the course of this thesis as well as an outlook on future work.
