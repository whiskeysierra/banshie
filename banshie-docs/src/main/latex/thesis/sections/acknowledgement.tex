\section*{Acknowledgements}
This project would not have been possible without the support of many people.

I wish to thank, first and foremost, Larysa Visengeriyeva for sharing her in-depth knowledge and helping me to bring some sense into the confusion. Many thanks to my advisor, Prof. Dr. Edlich, who read my revisions and offered guidance and support.

A very special thanks goes out to Annelie Sabin, who constantly helped to keep me focused on my thesis. I would also like to thank my friends and coworkers, particularly Sebastian Gröbler and Dennis Bläsing for always showing interest in my work and for proofreading. Appreciation also goes out to Andreas Gohr, for questioning my progress every other day. I would also like to thank my whole family for the support they provided me through my entire life.
