@mastersthesis{Linsmayr:2010,
	Abstract = {The present master thesis contributes to an automation and standardisation of the IE evaluation process. For that purpose an IE evaluation method is developed by first, defining a uniform output format for the IE process, second, selecting adequate IE quality metrics, third, incorporating different issues of partial correctness of IE results and fourth, designing a parameterized scoring procedure. The method is implemented in an IE evaluation framework prototype named Evaliex, which outperforms exisiting IE evaluation tools and is demonstrated on hand of three application scenarios covering eTourism, eRecruitment and eManufacturing.},
