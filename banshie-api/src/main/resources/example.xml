    <span type="person">Albert Einstein</span> (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born
    theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, effecting a revolution
    in physics. For this achievement, <span type="person">Einstein</span> is often regarded as
    the father of modern physics and the most influential physicist of the 20th century. While
    best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been dubbed "the world's
    most famous equation"), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to
    theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
    effect". The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.
