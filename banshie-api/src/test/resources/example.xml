    If the <span type="organization">Yankees</span>
    lose a playoff spot by a game or two, these are the
    nights that will sting all winter. On Tuesday, they lost on a blown
    save and a bases-loaded walk. On Wednesday, somehow, it got much worse.

    An error by <span type="person">Robinson Cano</span> set up the tying run.
    A wild pitch by Tanyon <span type="person">Sturtze</span>, who got his
    signals crossed with catcher <span type="person">Jorge Posada</span>, scored
    the go-ahead run. The result was a 7-6 victory for the last-place
    <span type="organization">Tampa Bay Devil Rays</span>, who have beaten the
    <span type="organization">Yankees</span> 9 of 13 times this season.
